My name is Nick; I am a 24-year-old male with severe asthma. I was diagnosed when I was 3 months old. When I turned 15 years of age, my asthma seemed to have disappeared. However, around the age of 20 my asthma has started coming back. It is also getting much worse then what it used to be and back in May of 2016, I was intubated and was in the ICU for about a week. Since then I have five more attacks that I was close to being intubated but was able to recover with the help from the ER. I have never figured out what my trigger is and have done some work, I need some assistance to try, and figure out what is triggering my asthma. Details are below.
 
Doctors:
Family Doctor
Asthma Specialist
Allergy Specialist

Medicine:
Advair
Ventolin
Montekulast (Sigulair)
Omeprazole (GERD)
Apo-Mometasone (Allergies and Post Nasal Drip)

Actions Taken:
Hypoallergenic bedding with asthma approval
Vacuum 2-3 times weekly
Dust 2-3 weekly             
Wear a respirator when cleaning
Removed Milk and Pop from diet
Regular workout (I do not have any issues while being active)
Steam Shower Nightly (This is recent but has been helping immensely)
Air purifiers (Home and Work)
Humidifiers (Home)
Removed all scents (cologne, soaps, air fresheners, etc.)
Wash my Cats frequently (They love water anyway)
Removed all water damage and mold (Remolded house when I moved in)
Smokeless Environment (Not near anyone who smokes and the few who do are not allowed to do in my car or in my house)
Wear heavy jackets and use a scarf over mouth when it is cold
Cats are not allowed in my room

Allergies:
Mice
Hamsters
Birch
I am not allergic to my cats however, I still take precautions.

I have been averaging on 4-5 attacks a year and I have issues where I need to use my rescue inhaler frequently. I have never had an attack on a weekend and about 80% of the time the issue occurs at work. Leaving work, it gets better within 30min with the help of rescue inhalers.

One more note is when I was younger it was always called asthmatic croup. My last visit to the hospital the doctor noted that my asthma presented a lot like croup still. Which should not be possible due to my age. He also noted that my upper airways are also closing.

33,Asthma or Anxiety,/forums/discuss/asthma-or-anxiety-533340,5,Asthma,Asthma or Anxiety," Hi there, I reckon I have suffered with anxiety for over 2 years now and the last few months have for progressively worse to the point my doctor wants to put me on antidepressants although I&#39;m not depressed, the 2 are different issues!  I have found at times that out the blue I start wheezing when inhaling and it&#39;s really scary as I automatically think I&#39;m going to stop breathing (hence the anxiety) I have had a chest X-ray, lung function test and ECG and all were normal in fact the spiriometery test was above average. I am really curious and any info regarding this would be really appreciated... Can anxiety really cause wheezing or have the doctors misdiagnosed and I may possibly have asthma?! &#129300; "," Hi Lisa,    Just a quick note of how much I understand what you&#39;re going through. I&#39;ve been sick for 16 years and because they can&#39;t find the biological basis for it the doctors that see me in the hospital try to say it&#39;s a psych thing. Never mind the two doctors who&#39;ve seen me all these years say differently. So, yeah, I get it.    So, as for you my dear, there is something that comes to mind regarding your symptoms that you might want to have considered. It&#39;s call vocal chord dysfunction (VCD) I can be caused by anxiety, anxiety definitely makes it worse. People may often be thought to have asthma but upon all the testing (PFT&#39;s and the like) its all negative. Then they find out they have a VERY treatable thing called VCD! You can see a speech therapist who can help you relearn talking and breathing techniques and teach you interventions to mitigate they symptoms and get you back to being focused on living rather than whether or not you&#39;re going to stop breathing or not. Whew! What a relief it would be! Huh?    So, the thing is, a lot of the anxylitics are actually addictive. Things like klonopin, xanax, and I think even ativan, can be physically addictive, as well as psychologically addictive. Addiction can run on both sides of the gamet. The body may become physically dependent on a drug, but the mind can also become dependent. So there can be a double whammy. That said, frequently, various classes of antidepressants are often used to very successfully treat mild anxiety. (It doesn&#39;t take much anxiety to make one feel that one can&#39;t breath!) The beauty of the antidepressants is that they aren&#39;t addictive! Ones like the class called tricyclic antidepressants are particularly useful in this area. There may well be some newer classes that I&#39;m not aware of. But the tricyclics are oldies but goodies, as the saying goes.    So in short, the antidepressants might be a good interim treatment to help you get through until you can figure out what&#39;s really going on!    Just remember, you can always get a second opinion, but you have to be careful about that. Because if you look long and hard enough, you&#39;ll eventually find a doctor to treat you the way you WANT to be treated, rather than the way you NEED to be treated!    I hope this helps. From what little I can gather, it sounds to me like you&#39;re doctors actually on the right tract!    Hope you feel better soon! ",positive,positive,

I have joined this forum because I have had asthma for my whole life and have to spend a lot of the time in hospital so the doctors can help me breathe abit easier.

","Hey Gracie,

I'm Kirsty and I'm 21 and it sounds like your asthma is very bad, like mine. I'm sorry that the other children at school are not very nice to you, its not your fault at all and you shouldn't have to listen to them.

I think you should talk to your doctors when you go to your appointments at the hospital and ask them if they can suggest someone that can help you to cope with the way the other children treat you. Having very bad asthma can be really scary and make you feel very alone, doctors know this so you should be honest with them and tell them how you feel

It might be that they can figure out a different mask for you to wear at school. What does the mask do? Or what is it called? There's sooooo many different types and some look nicer than others! 

If there is anything I can help with, just ask. Chin up sweetie, it won't always be this hard x

62,I am SO open to some HONEST KIND thoughts!,/forums/discuss/i-am-so-open-to-some-honest-kind-thoughts--519277,6,Asthma,I am SO open to some HONEST KIND thoughts!," I&#39;m feel like things are trying to spiral out of control on me!    I went to bed one night in Feb 2000 and was so far as I knew healthy. I woke up the next morning short of breath. It&#39;s been a downhill slide from there! Here I am 16 1/2 yrs later. I&#39;m on 6L of oxygen at rest and 8-10L on exertion. Not only can NO ONE figure out what&#39;s wrong with me, but they don&#39;t even know why I need the oxygen. In all the years, there have been over 30 hospitalizations with multiple intubations after I&#39;ve gone into respiratory failure and I have been told on as many as 3 occasions that I ALMOST died! AND YET . . . &#160;EVERY SINGLE TIME I have to go through a psychiatric evaluation to determine to SOMEONE&#39;S satisfaction that there is no psychosomatic componant. EVERY TIME! They always tell ME that I&#39;m fine that it&#39;s not psychosomatic, and yet no one will let it go! It&#39;s truly putting my health at risk. I don&#39;t suffer from anxiety, I have no fear of dying. I&#39;m in the hospital for God sake. That&#39;s the best place to be to be taken care of. I may be physically MISERABLE, but they&#39;ll do what they can to take care of me. So I try not to focus on not being able to breath and have developed excellent coping skills to attempt to stave off the normal anxiety. I almost NEVER feel anxious. At least not because of my breathing. I do get a liitle worried when I feel like I&#39;m not being taken seriously though and I&#39;m concerned about the additional health problems that may be being added to my current problems from the stress my body suffers from not being properly treated at times.    Perfect example is what I&#39;ve just been through. I hadn&#39;t been feeling well, like at my base line. So I checked with my doctors schedule to see what his upcoming availability was like. That was June 6th. He had ONE appt on Tues. the 7th and then NOTHING for two weeks. That meant he was most likely going to be out of town and if I did have a problem and have to go to the hospital, there would be NO ONE around that knew me. Where ever I went they&#39;d call his practice which is quite large and get whomever was on call to look into my records and the wouldn&#39;t find anything helpful because, well, NO ONE can figure out what&#39;s going on! So I decided I&#39;d better take the appt with him the next morning the 7th. I drove the hour to his office and got 5 min out I drove through and area where I could smell fresh cut grass. I knew in SECONDS that I was in trouble. Normally it doesn&#39;t bother me. But if I&#39;m below my baseline functioning everything seems to bother me. My airway becomes very twichy. I got to his office, and within 45 min I was in an ambulance going to the ED. I spent 2 hours in the ED and was then admitted in CRITICAL CONDITION to the Medical ICU. Within 30 min I was intubated due to respiratoty failure. I spent two days on the ventilator while my body tried to reset itself. On Sunday the 12th I was transferred to the regular floor, where on Monday I had another flair up. It was totally predictable. But there were some issues, and as a result I didn&#39;t get the treatment that I should have when I should have. I was supposed to have an inhaler to use, but it hadn&#39;t come up from the pharmacy, by the time I got it I was unable to use it. By the time I got a nebulizer it had been an hour without treatment.&#160;I went unresponsive so they called the rapid response team, a highly trained specialized group of doctors, nurses, respiratory thearapists etc that respond to emergent situations through out the hospital as needed. By then it had been almost two hours since it had started. IN TWO HOURS NO ONE PICKED UP A STETHASCOPE TO LISTEN TO MY LUNGS!!! NO ONE! When rapid response got there, they listened and said I was moving almost NO AIR . But I was moving JUST ENOUGH to have the gas exchange happen which aloud my body to keep my O2 sats above 90%, the acceptable range. Never mind that my VERY normal blood pressure of 90/60 SORED to 206/77 because I was working so hard to breath! But NO! I don&#39;t have a problem!!!! I test NEGATIVE FOR EVERYTHING!!! I might have MILD asthma, but supposedly NOTHING that would cause me this much trouble! I have been tested for SO MANY THINGS!!! Always, NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE!!! I was sent home on June 15th. I&#39;m still so far from baseline that I can&#39;t even bathe myself yet! It&#39;s really to the point where it&#39;s ridiculious!    I can&#39;t stand it anymore. Part of me, and PLEASE DO NOT READ INTO THIS WHAT IS NOT THERE!!!, but part of me almost wishes that I would just die from it and we&#39;d all be done with it. But THAT&#39;S NOT what I WANT! But the stress on my body is really beginning to take it&#39;s toll. My family is just beside themselves with concern and not knowing what to think.&#160;    AlLL I want is to be given palluatuve care!  &#160;We often only think of palliative care as being for the dying. But that&#39;s not true. Not anymore. I have a chronic illness of some kind. I DO NOT CARE IF THEY GIVE ME A DIAGNOSIS! &#160;I just don&#39;t. All I want them to do is when I show up keep me as comfortable and safe and they can in order to assist me to returning back to my baseline as possible and help me maintain as high a standard as living as I can. THEY DON&#39;T HAVE TO FIX IT!!! BECAUSE THEY CAN&#39;T! If something new crops up, like the acute eposodic heart failure that I&#39;ve had. Treat it. Fine. But I&#39;m so sick of because a doctor isn&#39;t taught to be comfortable with saying &quot;I don&#39;t KNOW!&quot; Then its ME that there must be some HIDDEN SECRET problem with or something! I&#39;m beginning to FEEL like I SOUND psychotic when I talk to them about it! They asked me in the ED if I wanted to be intubated. IT&#39;S A &#160;SIMPLE QUESTION! ONE I WAS AFRAID TO ANSWER BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID IT WAS A TRICK QUESTION! I WAS IN FREAKING RESPIRATORY FAILURE!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!?! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME!?!? I feel like they are CREATING a psych problem, or that they certainly will if they don&#39;t leave me the hell alone with this crap.    PLEASE!?!? Tell me I&#39;m not sounding as off the wall as I feel like I do! I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m FAST running out of rope!&#160;    Feel FREE to ask what ever questions you want!

66,Shortness of Breath / Tight Chest,/forums/discuss/shortness-of-breath-tight-chest-36242,6,Asthma,Shortness of Breath / Tight Chest,"Hi -

Apologies for the long message in advance but I would really appreciate any advice or help.

I am a 36 year old male - diagnosed with asthma since childhood. Been using Seretide for a few years now and my asthma has been well under control  with no recent attacks and I attended yearly reviews.

However,   In January this year I became breathless very suddenly and was eventually diagnosed with a chest infection. The shortness of breath and tightness in my chest has never gone although the chest infection cleared with erythomycin

The odd thing is my peak flow is consistently between 650 and 800 which is supposedly good and I don't have to use my Ventolin more than once a day if at all. My spirometry test was normal  in fact excellent and showed my lung age to be 10 years younger than I am. I have had 2 chest xrays - both clear. My GP has tried treatment for anxiety, GERD and candida but this has not worked. I had a barium swallow test today for hiatus hernia but this was negative.

I am really getting frustrated now - is it possible to have asthma but have normal spirometry and feel like this? I don't have a wheeze or cough and I am not producing sputum. It is just this continual tightness in the chest and shortness of breath. I continue to take Seretide. My doctors surgery are covinced there is no serious lung disease and are not keen on referring me to a chest physician but I am getting very scared now.

Has anyone have any idea what this may be or what I should do next. Up until Jan 2012 I have been perfectly healthy? Any help greatly appreciated.","Hi I can only think of hatha yoga, learning to breath properly, meditation, relaxation.

I have had severe asthma for over 10 years and never had an attack. I have done a lot of yoga however and sometimes I meditate.

I have a few other diseases too, so look after yourself and do as much alternative treatment as you can. 

Positive attitude always helps

I respond really well to accupuncture. Luckily I have a low cost alternative health clininc in Sheffield.

After a re-flair up and some meds I&#39;ve been clear for a few weeks (no Ventolin needed). &#160;However I noticed my peak scores drifting into the low 700s this week so I got curious. &#160;I also noticed a slight clearing cough in the morning like I had a little mucus in my very upper chest, but it&#39;s extremely minor and rare. &#160;    So today I came in at 730, on the low end of what I&#39;ve seen last 2 weeks. I blew about 5 tries to make sure I couldn&#39;t get higher then took two puffs Ventolin, waited 15 minutes, and voila I blew 770 without much trouble. &#160;So that is 5%. &#160;But other than that peak score no other symptoms, however my nose was going off and my chest had a very slight &quot;oppressive&quot; feel but no specific tightness.

79,Fear of an attack,/forums/discuss/fear-of-an-attack-399905,9,Asthma,Fear of an attack,"Since being diagnosed with anxiety/panic attacks and asthma last year, I live in fear of an attack.

I think it's due to not being 100% certain of the signs and symptoms of an asthma attack compared to that of a panic attack - is anyone able to help?
Also if it is asthma and I don't have an inhaler with me will I die?

My life has changed so much and I just want to go back to being 'normal' and knowing how to cope.
I wake up every morning dreading the day ahead and its impacted so much on my personal and working life.
I feel like I'm losing everything - my self, my confidence, my relationships with family and friends, my job etc


","Having had asthma all my life and also experiencing servere anxiety for a few years, I know the signs and symptoms can be very similiar, but a few things to consider:

- what came first? the asthma, or the panic? If you notice your chest is tight (or you are wheezing for example) and [b][i]then[/i][/b] you start to panic, it's likely that your asthma is playing up. If you start to panic for no reason and then notice asthma-like symptoms, it could be caused by anxiety.

- is there any wheezing present? if so, it's probably asthma. If not then the unpleasent sensations could be due to hyperventilation which is basically caused by [b]overbreathing[/b] too much oxygen (VERY common in people with anxiety). Research it.

- it's possible to experience asthma symptoms and remain calm (but asthma it's self can lead to feeling very anxious, which confuses things)

- have you ever had a full blown asthma attack? Being diagnosed with asthma doesn't mean you are guranteed to experience one

- in my experience panic attacks last longer and are more fightening. Also if it's an asthma attack, using the reliever usually helps within about 10-15mins and everything calms down after then.

Judging from your comments, your problem here is the anxiety (dreading the day ahead, losing confidence, wanting to be normal etc). Are you getting help with this?

And yes, an asthma attack could potenially kill you. But it depends on how severe your asthma is.

","Hi Becky

I'm afraid that I can't give you accurate information regarding Ibuprofen but wanted to send a virtual hug.   Toothache is horrible pain!

Things you could do are to call your GP and ask to speak to the Asthma Nurse (your practice, particularly in the UK) should have one.   She will have more 'technical' information for you.

Other than that it is, of course, possible that you are having a flare up of your asthma and that it is coincidental with your dental pain:  there are so many viruses around at the moment  and they may be making your chest unhappy.

If you stop taking the Ibuprofen, does the chest problem immediately clear?   I don't know how long it would take for the drug to clear your system - you should seek some help.

With regard to the dental pain - using the following could help (it has done me!):  
Put a whole clove on the gum where you have the pain.   Leave it there and replace as necessary, every few hours.   Don't use this at night if on an upper tooth as you could swallow it which probably... wouldn't harm you but it's not a great idea.  
Buy some 'clove oil' and follow directions on the bottle.   It does a similar thing to the whole clove.   
Sit upright:  I understand that the blood flow to a tooth is such that by sitting up, you reduce the pain of toothache.  
Swill your mouth with half a teaspoon of salt mixed with half a glass of hot water.   You could try doing a similar thing with a dispersible aspirin.
I also understand that 'mixing' drugs gives a better pain-killing effect, i.e. take one Ibuprofen with one Paracetamol.   Of course, be careful as there is a different dosage for each drug - they are not to  be taken more than the recommended doses (6 per day Ibuprofen, 8 per day Paracetamol).
Speak to a Pharmacist who could suggest a better drug regime.
Most of all, go back to your dentist and explain the pain you are in!

Wishing you a good outcome and less pain (and don't forget to seek advice on your breathing!).

It was an afternoon and in the afternoons I&#39;m better, as in I don&#39;t get so much shortness of breath.  He listened to my lungs said no infection (which is good). At first, from what he listened he thought I didn&#39;t have asthma. However, I had a spirometry and the numbers weren&#39;t normal. After the spirometry he put me in a glass box, no air getting in and I had to do something similar. That showed even more details. He then was sure I have asthma. Moderate asthma. Not mild. He prescribed me with fostair and I said I&#39;ve been recently prescribed with fostair for a common virus which he found stupid. I saw someone commenting that fostair won&#39;t really help , and I&#39;m not sure what to do next. He said do fostair 2 puffs every morning and night for a month and come back. He doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s allergic or not. I&#39;m not sure If I do it right though, as it persists and every morning, even after the puffs I feel drained and out of breath and I have to breathe really fast to catch my breath which worries me. I&#39;ve read that asthma can cause fatigue. Is this true ??    Could I be having asthma all these years building up? I moved to a new town due to university, in November. The climate here is not convenient at all. Winters are really cold and humid and summers are really really hot and humid too. Spring so far is bad too, so much pollen on the air! Since I moved it seems like I got bad sinuses too ( not diagnosed, but I felt like it in winter.) Could that trigger my asthma too? As it was building up all these &#160;years?    For now, I&#39;m gonna stick with the prescription but I&#39;m sure that if I went to the doctor in the morning, the numbers would be so much worse. He took my oxygen which was normal, 98% so I get enough oxygen. I still don&#39;t get where that fatigue is coming from and it &#160;worries me.&#160; "," Another weird thing that happens, is that I only get wheezing If I do a certain move.

I am a 21 year old female and about a month ago I had a sudden onset of dizziness and rapid pulse, I was also struggling to breathe a little but I assumed this was anxiety due to how I was feeling. I took my temperature which was normal (36.6) I thought that if I had these symptoms again I would go to the doctor. About two weeks later I started to have these episodes more frequently. I would get dizzy, light-headed, nauseas and have a very fast heart beat. I decided to go to the doctor as I couldnt carry on like that. The doctor was alarmed by my pulse and sent me for an ECG. The ECG showed my heart rate at 113. He said this was not normal and that we needed to find the underlying cause. He then sent me for a blood test testing my thyroid. In the mean time I was put on Pur-Bloka 10mg for the heart rate. My thyroid test came back normal and about 2 days later my chest started to feel tight and burn along with dizziness again. I went back to the doctor and he sent me for a lung function test and a stress ECG. The lung function test was horrible, it made me even more dizzy and tired. Anyway it was not good according to the doctor as my capacity was only 90%, he showed my the graph and that the slope was not at the right angle. The stress ECG was also not fun. Who wants to exercise when they are sick! It said my resting pulse was 90. Not sure what that means. The doctor looked at the results and gave me a prescription for and accuccuhaler to help my lungs and he ordered tests for anemia and a full blood count as he saw that I was pale in the face and on my palms. The anemia results came back and they were normal. I am not dizzy anymore but my main symptoms are still present- Bouts of rapid pulse and burning in the chest, also very tired. He has said that if the symptoms persist I should see a physician. I guess my question is, has anyone had such symptoms and then been diagnosed with asthma? I understand that there is a scale of severity in the type of asthma too. Will the accuhaler take a while to start working if it is mild asthma? should I wait before paying another fortune to see a physician? I'd love to read about any of your experiences with mild asthma and any other opinions. I find doctors dont always explain things to patients and I'm a little in the dark here.
Thanks guys ","Hi Jade,
I would be alarmed if I had those symptoms as well. What were the results of the ECG? IF your PFT was horrible, why are they not treating for your lungs? I can see why they might not give you albuterol, as that will raise your pulse due to the steroid pushing your lungs open. What were your activities when these took place? Anything strenous? Anything not strenous? Were you doing the same things at each time the symptoms hit? A normal pulse is anywhere from 56-100 here in the states. Anything over 100 is considered not good, which means your heart is working too heard. 113 is fast, but would not be alarming here in the states, unless you experienced exactly what you are. I agree with the blood work, I would not have seen the anemia test but that may cause some of the sympotms like fatigue, sudden dizziness with exercise, etc.. However it would not cause the chest pressure, and the shortness of breath. I would ask your doctor what the results of your stress test, as well as ECG report stated. Yes you had 90% lung function, however the question is why all of a sudden? Are you around a new chemical, powder? What you describe could be several things: anaphylaxis asthma attack, heart attack, and yes an asthma attack with exertion. What other doctor would he send you to? Do you have health insurance? What type of doctor was this person because you mentioned sending you to a physician? Trying to help.

I was diagnosed with asthma about 6 months ago when I was getting breathless and tight chest; however as I started suffering with really bad anxiety and panic attacks the doctors (and me) wasn't sure if it was actually asthma or a physical symptoms of my anxiety/panic attacks.

I was given a preventer and normal inhaler to use but I never did. Probably because part of my anxiety is I'm scared that taking medicine when not needed is dangerous.

Today however I went to the doctors as I've had a cough for some weeks now and she said she could hear wheezing on my chest, which apparently means it's asthma.
She told me I need to use my inhalers for 2 weeks and then go back.
She told me to use the inhalers with this adaptor thing (which I haven't got).
My fear now is:
1. Does wheezing really mean it's asthma
2. What happens if I don't take my inhalers (I'm scared to use them for 2 reasons - I don't have the adaptor thing and also apparently they increase your heart race (I already suffer with tachycardia so don't really want it increasing even more)

As far as adults go two doses is a baby dose... especially in the case of an exacerbation and if your peak flow is in the 200’s upon waking, there are likely things that can be done better.    Firstly though, it&#39;s near impossible to overdose on Ventolin, even at greater than 20 puffs a day... mind you that would be a sign of someone who is poorly managed. In emergency dosing it&#39;s not uncommon to have 8 puffs every 20 to 30 minutes. If you have a tendency towards tachycardia and other heart problems... which you do, then it could be a problem... but, like heart problems asthma kills a number of people on a weekly basis. This is something to discuss with your respiratory physician.    Ventolin will always be in your repertoire (it&#39;s the only rapidly acting short term bronchodilator there is)... however, it&#39;s possible to go onto 200/6 Symbicort two puffs morning, afternoon and evening... with upto an additional six puffs in place of Ventolin throughout the day. But, after that twelfth puff, you need to (technically) go back to Ventolin. Having said that, I&#39;ve been prescribed upto 12 puffs of 400/12 symbicort on a daily basis (but that&#39;s unconventional and technically not allowed).    Another thing to look into and doing a bit of a multi pronged attack, would be Spiriva of a morning. Spiriva and Atrovent (largely the same thing one is long acting the other short acting) work on different receptors to Ventolin.    Alvesco, is an inhaled steroid that can be used in conjunction, with the aforementioned medications.    Now, the above treatment got me from using 20 inhalations of ventolin a day (including prednisolone and seretide)), down to between four and six (with very occasional prednisolone use).    My regime is, one puff Spiriva, 2 puffs of Symbicort (200/6) and 2 puffs of Alvesco (160mcg) upon waking. Afternoon: two puffs of Symbicort (plus any additional doses I’ve needed). Evening 2 puffs Symbicort. Fexofenadine can help, but in a small percentage of the population can cause asthma like symptoms (I fell into that percentage).    As needed, I have Ventolin and Atrovent (inhalers and nebules for both), prednisolone. I can vouch for this treatment, though in Australia it’s now considered old school an epipen can be used in an emergency attack to get the airways open (but, given the heart problems it’s possibly not a good idea). I’ve been given adrenaline for asthma in the past and it works incredibly well. In fact my new GP has urged me to discuss getting an epipen in case I have a major exacerbation in a remote location.    Over the years, I’ve been on most asthma medications known to man. It&#39;s worth noting that sinusitis can cause twitchy airways as well. ",neutral,neutral,

Im 23 yrs old, f. Diagnosed of asthma since i was a child. I could have no asthma attck for months but when i do it is worse. Im not currently taking any maintenance before this started. 

Ive had an asthma flare up last month (March 2016) due to sore throat and cold. I've went to see my doctor and he prescribed me Symbicort, Albuterol neb and Z pack. Usually, this medicine combination would work for me but this time it doesn't. After finishing my Z pack and see only a little improvement I went back to him and this time he prescribed me a Medrol pack. It helped with my breathing but not completely. I know there is still something wrong. 

I finished my medrol pack but coughing and difficulty of breathing is still there. I have night sweats when I started Medrol and got a tinge of blood in my phlegm twice so he ordered chest xray cause he was thinking that I might have TB but chest xray is normal. 

I've went to see him again after finishing Medrol and he prescribed me a second round of Z pack because my phlegm became yellow every morning.

Again, I've finished Z pack and nothing has improved except the color of my phlegm. I'm getting frustrated and anxious that time cause I don't know what is happening to me and why the medicines are not working. 

The following weekend I was supposed to travel but I'm monitoring myself if my body is strong enough or not. Symptoms are still there so I decided to go to an Urgent Care because I cannot see my doctor soon enough. They prescribed me Prednisone for 7 days and a cough medicine. Unfortunately, I cancelled my flight because I'd rather not compromise my health. I went to my doctor for the nth time and every time he listens to my lungs it was perfectly fine but I would explain to him that my back is tight and I am still experiencing difficulty breathing. He can't even explain what was happening. He just told me to continue Symbicort and that's it. I was asking if he would add another or change my inhaler but he decided not to.

I decided to go to an ENT to have my throat check due to recurring sore throat and he performed Endoscopy and he said that I don't need to worry about my throat cause it was fine. He mentioned that it might be acid reflux that causing my throat irritation. He didn't prescribed anything but he advised me foods that I need to avoid.

I went for a second opinion for Pulmonologist and they performed PFT. The results were ok. Lungs are cleared and the doctor told me that acid reflux might be the underlying cause of all this. She also told me to stop using albuterol neb (I'm using it day and night) cause it might be causing the acid reflux and only use it whenever needed. She prescribed Pantropazole 40mg once a day. She also ordered some blood work if I have any allergies and because I told her I'm still having night sweats despite that I already finish my dose of Prednisone. Again, they wanted to rule out the possibility of TB. 

I'm still on Symbicort and on my 6th day of Pantropazole and I don't see any improvement. I could have chest tightness or back tightness for the whole day everyday, it's either one or the other. Along with the night sweats, I would wake up very early (around 4 or 5) everyday with chest tightness or sometimes dry mouth and phlegm stuck in my throat. I only drink water or herbal tea since i got sick. I try to eat healthy and avoid foods that can cause acid reflux. I don't know but sometimes I'm skeptical if this is really acid reflux or something else. Sometimes I would think that there's still an infection left from my sore throat and cold from the beginning. It's been 7 weeks and i'm getting more worried. I forgot how it feels like to breath normally :( I'll have my doctor's appointment again on the next two weeks. Has anyone experience same symptoms??","Having had Asthma my whole life now. I'll see if I might be able to provide some level of insight as to what could be going on. Asthma is a strange beast, even if you rarely have an attack... or grow"" out of it, the potential is always there for something to cause a flareup at some stage in life.

​A couple things to ask, what dosage symbicort​ are you taking, how many puffs and how many times of the day? What is the maximal allowable dose that you've been prescribed. It can take a good week or two of Consistantly using symbicort​ for it to start having full effect.

​I used to have severe Astma, but now with the new drug classes, it's been re-classified to moderate, difficult to manage. Symbicort by itself doesn't help me completely I'm on 200/6 upto 12 puffs a day (100/3 is a childs dose)... 2 morning, 2 afternoon and 2 evening. with an additional 6 during the day if needed (ventolin puffer after that). On top of that I take Spiriva of a morning. That combination predominantely keeps me managed... if not then I sart breaking out the Alvesco 160ug... with Ventolin and Atrovent nebules if needed. Escaluating further, if that all doesn't help then I start breaking out the prednisolone at 37.5mg. 

​Reflux can cause Asthma. The question is do you suffer reflux and heartburn? Are you aware of your triggers? Could be pollens, plants, pet hair, cold air, petrochemicals (if for example they've been laying down new tar recently where you live or work) among many many other things. Have you ever had a skin prick test done and have they tested for Aspergillus (a type of fugal infection) which can cause persistant asthma (blood test). It can be treated with Itraconazole.

The blood allergy tests can be rendered somewhat ineffective at greater than 30mg hydrocortisol equivelent (a bit over 5mg of prednisolone).. and are completely useless if you've been taking antihistamine​s in the previous 7 days. Though chances are you would've been told not to take antihistamine​s in the lead up to it.

​Are there any molds where you're living, they can wreak havoc with your lungs too. Judging from what you said, it sounds like you had a chest infection of some type. Being Astmatic... it can take a number of weeks to months for your breathing to get back to normal after a chest infection. I've personally had it take a number of months in the past.

​Here's another question, are you tighter breathing in... breathing out? How much stress have you been under lately? Studies have shown that stress can cause an increase in severity of Asthma... there is also a condition called Vocal Cord Dysfunction... they can sometimes pick it up during spirometry (in the cabinate when you're breathing into that machine) testing. A number of Asthmatics have VCD as a comorbidity. The characteristic of VCD is tightness while breathing in and it can often be mistaken as being Asthma, only the typical medications don't treat it effectively.

​Another question, has anyone tried doing a throat culture, to see what the infection is. Prednisolone is contraindicated where there might be a fungal infection (becuase it suppresses the immune system at higher doses).. not something most people have to worry about, it's less of an issue during shorter courses as well. Prednisolone is a whole body freakout drug, it has the potential to affect every system in the body. It could easily account for the night sweats, even if you have finished the course.

Drink plenty of fluids to try and break up the mucus in your throat. It's possible that another antibiotic may need to be tried, The bug you have (assuming it's bacterial) could be resistant to the Azithromycin. You've been sick going on a month (if not a little more), something is going on. The ant acid is likely going to reduce the effectiveness of any medications and nutriant absorbtion... due to the lowering of stomach acid.. unless you have genuine reflux, it could cause more problems then it's worth. Consider trying Doxycycline, which is one of the few antibiotics I'm able to actually take. But really, they need to isolate whether it's bacterial, viral or fungal and treat appropriately from there. If it's viral there's not a lot can be done.",negative,neutral,

",/forums/discuss/progression-of-severity-what-would-be-next--607208,5,Asthma,"Progression of severity, what would be next?"," To shine some light on my background relating to my asthma: I&#39;m almost 18, this was going to be my final school year but my asthma has taken 10+ weeks out of my attendance, so I&#39;m in school next year as my final year. My athsma was fairly mild most of my life and began progressing early 2016, where I was given seretide as a preventer. Now, in 2017 I&#39;ve had 5 hospitalisations and 2 ICU admissions where I&#39;ve required non-invasive mechanical ventilation, this was given through bipap and high-flow nasal prongs.&#160;  I didn&#39;t think it could really go much worse than that. But I always relatively had great oxygen diffusion in my lungs no matter how bad my attacks were, my oxygen simply NEVER dropped below 90. The lowest I had ever seen it was at 90.&#160;  Yet in my most recent hospitalisation, I was having only a mild/moderate attack, I could talk about 4 words at a time and didn&#39;t feel too panicked. Although my oxygen was at 79. I was fairly lightheaded and felt almost &#39;detached&#39; from the situation. I was given oxygen and when my oxygen became relatively stable I was admitted overnight for observation.    I&#39;m currently taking:  •Symbicort 200/6 (2 puffs twice a day)  •Spiriva (2 puffs in the morning)  •Montelukast (10mg daily)  •Prednisolone (10mg daily)  •Salbutamol (as required)  I&#39;ve also had to purchase a nebuliser as I find salbutamol and ipratropium treatments through a nebuliser are FAR more beneficial in controlling my asthma than a puffer and spacer (yes, despite evidence suggesting there should be no difference).  My asthma is classed as brittle, and my condition can quickly deteriorate without immediate treatment.&#160;    Now that I&#39;ve got this added problem where my oxygen fluctuates incredible amounts (I may be at 84 before a neb, 100 afterwards, spend the whole day being at 100. Then the next day it may be all over the place, changing often with or without asthma symptoms and treatment). I don&#39;t know what to expect from the doctors or specialist next. Only 6 months ago I never thought I&#39;d ever be on prednisolone daily, let alone any other problem.&#160;    Is there anyone here who could possibly predict what might be the doctor/specialists next step regarding such variation in my oxygen as only a more recent problem? I don&#39;t mind if it&#39;s a rough guess and you&#39;re not 100% sure, I won&#39;t hold anyone to anything they say haha, after all, treatment differs so much from person-to-person.&#160;  Any comment are absolutely greatly appreciated!! ",Am not sure t about some of the medicine you are on. But I know my o2 level would get low even when I didn&#39;t feel bad like 91 or 92.

I&#39;m 29 and never had it in my life or used an inhaler until 2 days ago.     To sum things up: I quit smoking last Feb after 13 years and noticed that after that I didn&#39;t cough any &quot;gunk&quot; up that people talk about coughing up. I developed asthma (never diagnosed other than MD listening to lungs and saying it sounds tight in there) out of the blue a few months later and was given Ventolin HFA.    I finally just used it (8 months later) and now it&#39;s causing me to cough up mucus. Is this a good thing?     I also just had a chest x ray Saturday for chest pain and it said I had mild hypo inflation and subtle bibasilar atelectasis so I know something is going on as to why I can&#39;t breathe very well.    I do also have a ton of allergies (that I was just tested for the first time in my life this year) and the ENT mentioned I&#39;m probably going to need allergy shots down the lines.    **So basically, I wanna know if coughing up the mucus after the inhaler is normal and if allergy shots helped any of you with your asthma?

When checking out my sinuses they did the allergy tests as a matter of course but all were negative so don&#39;t know much about that side of things.

Nebulising salbutomal seems to be far more effective .I&#39;ve had it in hospital emergency room and when I was hospitalised with pneumonia this year. My understanding is that give you the salbutamol through the nebuliser to loosen the chest and shift the mucus a bit.maybe the ventolin (salbutamol) reliever inhalor is just affecting you in a similar way because your body is not used to it?? Prob best to check with your doc for peace of mind.sorry but don&#39;t know much about the other condition you mentioned .again maybe the doc would explain any link with it to your current symptoms.good luck  ",neutral,neutral,

But about 6 months ago I woke up in the night very wheezy and short of breath. I was coughing for about 45 mins to an hour before I could finally get back to sleep. It was very scary as it felt like I was breathing through a straw and if it went any tighter I don’t think I’d have been able to breathe at all.
This happened again twice but about 4 weeks apart each time so I went to the doctors and they gave me a blue asthma pump and said to use it as and when I felt I need it. 

I didn’t use it for a while and wondered if I ever would but the ‘attacks’ did come back. 

Now I’m finding I’m using the pump about once a week but the only thing I find strange is that it always happens when I’m asleep?

The pump does help and relaxes my airways. I continue to cough but it feels more loose and I feel much better very quickly whereas if I didn’t use the pump it could take about an hour to feel better. 

Every time I’ve used my pump I’ve only had to use it once until earlier this week I found I had to use it twice. And last night I felt like it didn’t provide much relief at all. 

If I ever sneeze I find I feel a bit wheezy and tight chested after so wonder if it could be allergies? But I have never suffered with allergies before. 

I am going to make an appointment to see my doctor as he said to go back if I find I need to use it regularly but just wondering if anyone has these symptoms and know what I might have?","Hi sounds very familiar to me I have had asthma for years and the fact that your chest tightness eases when you use the blue inhaler it sounds like it is asthma.
 
The cough at night, may be helped by using an extra pillow 

I think you will be wise to back to your doctor he may do some tests and maybe put you on a different inhaler you may be affected by an allergy.

After explaining my prior experiences with asthma...I was given a zpac, prednisone and albuterol solution for nebulizer. Yesterday I had a physical with GP and she heard wheezing deep in my lungs and said I am definitely having some issues and she prescribed singulair for 2 months.

Before I comment on that, I wonder why the er gave you antibiotics. Did you have a bacterial infection?  Most modern health providers do not advocate giving patients zpacs or other antibiotics as a &quot;preventive&quot; measure.  The flu is a viral illness and antibiotics do not help. The exception is if your lungs or bronchii become infected. As to the wheezing, sometimes it is going to be louder than others, and sometimes it goes away altogether .  I have gotten up in the morning wheezing so loudly you wouldn&#39;t need a stethoscope to hear it.  But sometimes when I get to the doctor, my chest has cleared up so well there&#39;s only a tiny bit of sound. I think your doctor was correct in prescribing the singulair. If your asthma symptoms are mild, singulair should get it under control.  The other hallmark symptoms of asthma are coughing and shortness of breath. There are people with asthma who don&#39;t wheeze much but cough, but still feel like they cannot breathe. If you don&#39;t have any of these symptoms. .. only occasional wheezing... you might not even have asthma. It could be another cold.  Or maybe you have reduced your exposure to allergens that trigger bad asthma attacks. Several years ago I gave away my main trigger... my cat.  I stil wheeze a lot, but the s.o.b. is much much better. Now, I only worry about a full-blown asthma attack if I catch a bad cold.  Unfortunately, a chest cold will land me in the hospital for 2 or 3 days, because my weakened, asthmatic lungs cannot handle the extra phlegm. I will need massive doses of iv steroids over a couple of days to open me up and get cleared out. Have you ever seen a pulmonologist?  I recommend you make an appointment asap.

","So sorry to hear that you are going through this. Last year I had something similar chest tightness, cough, sinus issues / congestion and phlegm . No fever or sore throat. I was treated with antibiotics which really didnt help. So after about 2 months  I went to an ENT they did a CT scan of sinuses  and they said that my sinuses were all inflamed and it could be allergies causing all of this. So then I saw an allergist and he did allergy testing and the only thing I was allergic too was mold. He also said that the mold allergy was causing asthma symtoms so he prescribed an inhaler, flonase nasal spray and zyrtec . With the inhaler the cough got better right away. Then slowly the nasal symtoms  got better . I do use the medications daily to keep it from flaring up again. I am so thankful that I went to the allergist because he was the only one that knew how to treat me. If i had stayed with the ENT they wanted me to have sinus surgery without even knowing what was causing all of my symtoms. I wish you the best and please keep us informed . Happy Holidays .

Recently my surgery changed this preventer inhaler from Seretide to Combisol. I was taking Combisol which doesn't have a meter at the back like Seretide where you can keep track how many doses are left inside. I was writing down on paper how many doses I took and after 60  puffs or so the canister started to feel really empty and now I'm not getting enough medicine in my lungs, it is just a tiny puff.  Now though they've let me back on Seretide but I will have to wait a few days for it to arrive in the Pharmacy because I have to wait over the weekend and 2 working days.
My question is if you're not taking a preventer inhaler for a few days because you've ran out, is this bad or normally well tolerated? I have my Ventolin inhaler still, should I take more puffs of that whilst I wait for my preventer inhaler? I have mild asthma but don't want it to worsen whilst I wait, I can't remember not taking a preventer inhaler for a few days.

","I am sure that there will be better responses to your question than mine but I am wondering if your canister of Combisol is as empty as you think it is.

How many doses are indicated in the accompanying leaflet?   60 does not seem very much to me although I am not familiar with Combisol.

I would keep using the canister but also speak to your Pharmacist and ask him/her to expedite the Seretide for you.   Sometimes, if you have a good relationship with your pharmacy, they may just give you a Seretide from stock if they can be sure that a prescription will follow.   I would have thought that Seretide is something that a pharmacy would keep in stock (although these are difficult times for them).   Speak to them first thing tomorrow morning and see if they can help you.

As to how you will be if your Combisol has actually run out, no one knows.   It will depend on how you are in yourself.   It takes several days for these drugs to work fully so perhaps it takes several days before you are back to square one!  Hopefully there will be someone better informed than I to advise you.   The lesson here is to try to keep one step ahead and not to run out (easily written, I know and we have probably all done it at one time or another!).

","Hi Cat 67407

It must be worrying for you to have a change in your breathing and as you are pregnant probably even more so.

There are wiser posters on here who may be able to give you some further insight but from what you have said it is impossible to definitely diagnose asthma from your symptoms.

I know the medical world has been turned upside down with Covid at the moment but every GP's surgery that I have heard of is open and are dealing with patients.   You would need to telephone and tell (probably) the Receptionist your symptoms and she will almost certainly ask a doctor to call you back - usually within a couple of hours.

When you speak to a doctor they will either prescribe something to help you by 'phone (sending the prescription direct to a chemist you choose) or, ask you to come and see them.   Most surgeries have 'hot' (i.e. dealing with probable Covid patients) or 'cold', (dealing with non-Covid patients) hubs and you would  be directed to one or the other.

I was at my doctor's surgery the other day and their precautions were admirable and I have no worries about contracting Covid whilst there.

As you are quite heavily pregnant, do think about ringing for some medical advice, as simple treatment for asthma will not harm your baby and will make you feel so much better.   Just be honest when the Receptionist triages you (i.e. asks you questions about how you are and if you have any cough, high temperature etc).

Everyone here knows how awful it is not be a simple thing such as breathing!   Please ring today and ask to see a doctor so you can be sorted out with whatever your problem is.

Currently on 500ml Methyl Pred infusions every 6 weeks.  I also have Rituximab infusions every 6 months.  Nothing is really working for my disease.

I have no idea how bad my lungs are, what to do.  GP not interested either.  I hardly ever go outside because I am so ill with my CSS, my breathing is poor with exercise, just normal walking and every day tasks kill me.  Just getting so worried as went out yesterday to ENT by Ambulance as I am so ill, just walking a few yards to the ambulance had to take 10 puffers to breathe normally, scared the life out of the driver.

Its not on, should someone be looking after my Asthma?  Because I have a auto-immune problem GP says see consultant, consultant says see GP.  If I don't go out or move I am fine I suppose, just with exertion I am breathless, hubby getting scared now that I am left like this and my lungs are shot.

But it's difficult to know if you have asthma, based on two of episodes of SOB (shortness of breath).  The coughing fits when you inhale do sound suspiciously like asthma.   I hate to say you might have to experience several more fits before a doctor will diagnose asthma.  There just isn't any blood test or anything to confirm it.  But they can listen to your lungs through a stethoscope to hear if you are also wheezing.  You can also be allergy tested to determine what you might be allergic to, and therefore what is likely to cause your breathing problems.  Most importantly, go to the ER when you have SOB.  The inhaler medicine can also help diagnose asthma.  Generally, if your breathing gets better after an albuterol treatment. it is probably asthma.  If it's something else, you won't respond to the albuterol. I don't wish asthma on you, but I know it's better to know there's a reason for SOB, and treatment for it.

I was short of breath one summer when it was fairly humid and the air quality was not great. I went to my GP and they gave me a suck & blow (PFT) test. My breathing efficiency at the time was about 50%. They put me on Advair and a puffer. The puffers have never really made a difference, as I've never had an 'attack'. I eventually started feeling better and stopped taking the Advair, as it did not make a noticeable difference.

About 4 years ago, it bothered my breathing when I ate, my abdomen became bloated and I found it hard to breath. My doctor sent me to a respirologist who spent 2 years doing PFTs, but did not provide any answers. I finally asked him to do a chest x ray , which showed that I had atelectasis and an elevated hemi-diaphragm. The doctor blamed this on my Ankylosing Spondylitis, but the Rheumatologist said this was BS, as my chest expansion was fine and AS would affect the upper chest.

I asked my doctor to refer me to a second rheumatologist. He did a few additional tests, including a blood gas test and an asthma challenge. I failed the Asthma challenge, but only after they gave me significant amounts of methacholine. They also did a blood gas test and found my PAO2 was 66%. Based on some algorithm, he determined that I had a hole in mt heart. I'm thinking you're FoS, but OK off we go for a bunch of heart tests that discovered that my elevated diaphragm bothers my heart when lying down. They also did an ultrasound of my diaphragm, which showed that it is not paralyzed.  Respirologist #2 decided that my breathing issues are related to my very mild sleep apnea. Repirologist #1, who is also a sleep doctor, said this is complete horses***. 

I had a PFT at Repirologist #1 recently and I could tell the results were worse. The doctor did not tell me the numbers when I saw him for the folow-up, so I said the test seemed to be worse. He said yes the test was not as good the previous one, but it is in range with results over the past two years. Blah, Blah. He still did not give me the numbers. I mentioned that Ventolin does not seem to make a difference during my PFT, he agreed.

My doctor said to me at one time, it looks like they are just going to monitor your results as they get worse. At on point I said to my doctor that I came to you with problems X, Y and Z, and three years later I still have problems X, Y and Z.  My doctor changed clinics shortly after that and dropped me. Other patients followed her, as the clinic mentioned it. I was not given the option.

Sorry for the rant, but my question is that this does not seem to be Asthma. In fact I recently had to go to the walk-in for Bronchitis and they said you have COPD. Since our medical records are all centralized and available online, it makes me wonder what's in my file.

When you at least know what you have, it makes a big difference in how you manage your life. 

In general, I agree with you that it is doubtful you have asthma if you have never gotten relief from a rescue inhaler, as in albuterol.  Noticeable improvement after using an inhaler is a gold standard for helping diagnose asthma. And you said you have never had an asthma attack, which generally involves wheezing and excessive coughing, as well as shortness of breath. That doesn't sound like asthma or COPD, to me, either.

You mentioned having a ""suck and blow"" test which was at ""50 percent."" This could have been a very low tech test that uses a small, plastic mechanism called a peak flow meter. You take a big breath and then blow into this little device.  The idea is your doctor has you use it, or you have your own at home, and you blow into it when you' re feeling fine.... no shortness of breath (SOB). The number you reach is your ""peak flow.""   For instance, the average healthy man (and many women) can easily blow about a 700 on the peak flow. If you blew 50 percent, that meant you might have tested at about 350 to 400.  Not great but not considered the danger zone.  As a personal example, I just got out the hospital for after 3 days due to an asthma attack.  I only blew a 150.  Made the same score twice, and it made me cough like crazy. That number was pretty miserable. But they all knew I had asthma (I also have very LOUD wheezing) so they were just trying to see if I was getting better.

And what is an ""asthma challenge?"" Did you actually have a full- blown lung function test? 

I suggest you see a bona fide pulmonologist and get the lung function test.  If it is not asthma or bronchitis or emphysema, etc., something else is going on with your breathing and it could be any number of conditions.  You might need a cardiologist. No reputable doctor should be waiting for you to break down completely in order to get you a correct diagnosis!

My mum is 46 years old and has had what shes been told is asthma for Many years,she does smoke also.

","Jadex we both (and your Mum)  fully understand the implications of smoking for a start and coughing can be related to the habit of smoking..
However your Mum (only 45) needs to visit her GP/Practice nurse to ascertain that it is Asthma.
Two serious topics- Smoking - Asthma.
If the diagnosis is Asthma she needs to protect herself from an unexpected Asthma
attack with the relevant nebuliser/sterod inhalers etc appropriate medication, as Asthma attacks can be fatal, if not addressed properly.
Also if at all possible TRY to dissuade her from smoking....otherwise when you are older, your Mum may become a Grandmother etc, she may miss out on such special times in all your lives.

In 2006 my grandmother died. This was a traumatic experience as she was healthy and strong. Her death was sudden and unexpected. This caused my chest to become so tight that the Drs had to give me nebulizers to open my airways. They later said i have asthma. Without warning my chest would just lock tight and I was unable to breathe. Since 2006 my chest has got so bad that I have been given the brown pump, antibiotics and prednisolone literally every other month. I am now producing excessive phylem and a gurrling sound. The phylem is always green despite antibiotics. My recent episode is being admitted to A&E where I was injected IV with aminophyline 250 mg & Magnisum 2g. I've been to the Hospital today (Tuesday 28/8/2012) The Drs have ruled bronchietasis via CT scan.  They say its Asthma.  All the Asthma suffers I hav eknow in the past do not produce excessive green/brown phylem? Any advice would be greatly appreciated?
","Hi caramel, I saw no one had answered your question and I know how dispiriting this can be.
I can't really help you as I don't have your problem but I am an asthmatic, I am under control with my inhalers.

I have not smoked for the past 40 years.  I have been using Ventolin (Salbutamol);  Atrovent and a small dose of Q Var daily.
These have gradually become less effective.   Recently I was prescribed Fostair, (beclamethasone/formeterol) as an inhaler, which I understand is fairly new. This seems to be very effective, but the Consultant told me to use a spacer - in fact I was given a new one with my prescription.  However, it states clearly on the side of the Fostair packet, \&quot;Not to be used with a spacer\&quot;.   It appears that Fostair has not been tested using a spacer.   At present I am using just the inhaler without a spacer.This is a little confusing.  Also, I was told by the pharmacist that there is no need to refrigerate this drug once usage has begun.  However, on the instructions it states, \&quot;Store in a refrigerator\&quot;, which is what I am doing at the moment.   

I already have Essential Tremor, (an inherited condition), which means my hands shake.   Fostair seems to have made this slightly worse, but I was warned about it. Is anyone else using Fostair inhaler?  If so, what are your thoughts?
  
Good wishes to all.","Hi Dancer - I have emphysema COPD.  You posted this quite a while ago but I will give my experience in case it may be of interest to others also.

I don't use the combination inhaler Fostair, (beclamethasone/formeterol)  but I am using both formoterol and beclamethasone separately.  

I use the spacer for beclamethasone dip (Qvar) as I find it helps me get the drug deeper into my lungs, I also feel it helps prevent thrush in the mouth, although I do rinse and gargle after using this medicine.  

I take one dose in the morning of formoterol fumerate 12 micrograms.  I was originally prescribed 1 puff twice daily (one in morning and one at night) but found this medicine gave cramps in the extremities when on two doses.  After consultation with the doc I now only take one dose in the mornings and very rarely do I get muscle cramping now.

I find the Salbutamol in excess gives the shakes.

I can't comment about refrigeration only that I don't store any of my respiratory inhalers in the refrigerator.  

Hope this will be of some help to someone, sometime.

Are you in a hot climate Dancer?  Thinking about the medicine refrigeration.

I&#39;m certain that when you call &amp; explain your daughter&#39;s asthma is flaring up they will get you in really quickly - usually within 24hrs. Does she have an action plan? What&#39;s her peak flow like? Worse than usual?   Sometimes it just flares for no reason. Sometimes you can figure out the reason if you notice a pattern that should lead you to a trigger that you can then take notice if for the future. I personally find the weather a BIG problem do the change in seasons leads to problems - I start taking antihistamines in Jan/Feb to ward off hayfever.   I would call the surgery in the morning &amp; get her in asap. They&#39;ll check her over &amp; come up with a plan if action for her. The sooner she gets further treatment the quicker she&#39;ll start to find her symptoms ease &amp; hopefully manage it more easily in the future. Good luck x ",positive,positive,

I've been diagnosed with having anxiety and also asthma. However, I'm not 100% convinced it's asthma but feel it's anxiety.

I was prescribed both the blue and brown inhalers to use but have yet to use these, partly due to not knowing if it is asthma.

Could someone please tell me:
What symptoms you get with your asthma? Also how do you know when you're having an attack and what do you do to relieve it before seeking help?

I seriously wish my mind didn't over think things but I can't help it.
I just feel I need reassuring.","Hi tinytitch

No hun it doesn't sound stupid.  If it's worrying you then that's enough reason to ask.

I am wondering if you have had a lung function test.  They usually test you at the hospital (spirometry etc) then you would inhale a bronchodilator and wait 20 minutes and then they would do the test again to test for reversibility.

You might want to try the inhalers just to see if you feel it improves your breathing, or are you afraid of the drugs themselves?

What are they doing about your anxiety?  Congnitive Behaviour Therapy is helpful.  Also there is a website called No Panic which can be helpful.  I would put the link up for you but it takes forever on this site for the mods to allow the links.

Wishing you the best.

It may not be linked, the and was due to a bad life changing event.  I was against taking any preventer anyway and doc is not good , a very sarcastic person so I can&#39;t return there. "," Hi earthloop     I hope things level out for you. Anxiety is hard enough to cope with on its own without asthma .if I am honest I would strongly encourage you to take your preventer religiously. I didn&#39;t for years thinking I didn&#39;t really need it and consequently my chest got considerably worse leading to more frequent asthma attacks or chest infections. I&#39;m on my third course of steroids (prednisone) this year already .I also developed pneumonia 2 years ago .I am a rather anxious person myself .kind of worry about everything and everyone. I lost my darling mum 13 months ago to chronic lung disease .she was hospitalised frequently in the last years of her life .when she was ill and needed me i would almost run on automatic pilot but when she would start to recover i often dipped and my chest would flare up.i genuinely believe anxiety and asthma are closely linked .even if you feel you&#39;re developing anxiety issues as a result of your preventative meds I would hope  when they get into your system any anxiety linked to the inhalors would dampen down.?There is much less steroids in inhalors than in the oral tablets which most definitely cause horrible side effects such as difficulty sleeping, irritability and at times increased hunger .I would say taking the preventer is better as it might hopefully stop the need for any steroid tabs in the future which could make you feel a whole lot worse.  You say you don&#39;t like your doc.some of their manners leave a lot to be desired.one of our lady GPs at our clinic is an absolute horror so much so many patients refuse an appt with her but the sad fact is she is one of the best diagnostics in the place. She once  told me I was &quot;very anxious&quot; when I was discussing a ladies problem.lets just say if I was nervous or anxious sounding at first I felt a hell of a lot worse by the time I left the docs.

The inhaler has instructions on it for max use in a time frame. It's been a while so I can't remember but if she's needing it more than 4 times in a 4 hour time frame then I think it's time to take her to the doctor.

608,Possible asthma???,/forums/discuss/possible-asthma--682607,3,Asthma,Possible asthma???,"Hi everyone, 
I've had brief bouts of pneumonia or bronchitis each winter for the last several years, but other than that never had any breathing problems. I'm a 40-year-old female and I know I'm obese and am working on that. Allergies have come up in the last few years for the first time, leading to sinus pressure and post-nasal drip. I also have acid reflux that my doc and I are working on controlling. 

Today I noticed that after a brisk but not crazy hard walk today, I had some mucus in my throat and chest tightness. Previously I'd had that only twice after extreme workouts where I accidentally ended up in the Zone 5 heart rate zone. Now I'm wondering if it's asthma. I've already emailed my doc and will go in soon, but in the meantime, any words of comfort??? I'm freaking out a little; I also have an anxiety disorder which flares up when I have health concerns.  Will I still be able to exercise? Will this go away as I lose weight? Is it even asthma, or just the reflux plus the remnants of a really awful virus this spring?

I know my doc needs to answer all these things and I promise I'll see her, but I'm hoping you all can just help reassure me in the meantime.  No one on my family has asthma so I know nothing about it, which makes it extra scary. Plus I feel ashamed that I've allowed myself to get so overweight and feel like it's my fault that I'm having these problems. 

Thanks everyone... just needed to get that of my chest, I guess.  (Haha.)
Beth","Hello from one Beth to another Beth 

I am 43 years old .I had childhood asthma that went away and came back approximately 20 years ago following a bad chest infection.

initially my asthma in adulthood didn't pose a lot of problems. I could do most things I did before (exercise, dancing etc ) I also used to socialise on a weekly basis on the pub/club circuit (more money days and pre marriage and kids). this was prior to the smoking ban and back then cigarette smoke never flared up my asthma . the only real time I had a problem was when I had a chest infection as this would flare up things and occasionally I would need steroids and or antibiotics. back then I never took my preventative inhaler religiously (thinking I never needed it) and I now totally regret that.

i would say my asthma has probably deteriorated about the last 12 years or so .again the asthma seems to be worse after a cold or chest infection  which are far more frequent than before . I reckon I am on steroids and antibiotics at least 4 times a year. Unfortunately the 5 day of 40 mg steroid is never a long enough dose and it usually takes a 10 day steroid course to settle stuff down.

I now suffer from a post nasal drip (diagnosed about 6 years ago) and rhinitis .Unfortunately the ENT specialist said I'm not a candidate for surgery with my rhinitis. I do feel sometimes that it's the nasal drip and rhinitis that are the main cause of my daily cough .I cough so much that im often unaware of it . I believe that central heating can exacerbate my asthma and cigarette smoke from others most definitely makes my asthma symptoms worse .

I lost my mum last year. she suffered chronic lung problems for approx 46 years and for that last 9 years or so she wore round the clock oxygen. funnily enough out of mums 4 lung conditions asthma was never diagnosed albeit from chatting to one of her consultants they said a patient can develop asthma at any age. What I would say is that when mum would end up hospitalised and very ill, i would run on automatic pilot, making sure I visited mum for hours daily, still working and looking after my kids. i remember there was many a time that mum would be discharged  and ""recovered"" as best as possible then at such times my asthma symptoms would kick in . I definitely believe stress and anxiety is a factor in my asthma symptoms. I am quite an anxious person by nature so it's a hard thing to control. I was nearly hospitalised on my daughter's birthday in June but eventually the nebulizer at the hospital did the trick and discharged me. sometimes such nebulizer help, other times not so much .when attending A and E that time the medical staff suggested I started yoga to help with my breathing . i do intend to get organised and start it (soon) I haven't exercised much in recent years. I know exercise suppose to help asthmatics but I usual end up with exercise induced asthma symptoms.

You mention that you may have been getting bouts of pneumonia or bronchitis . can I ask if this has been formally diagnosed.? I had it pneumonia 2 and a half years ago and was hospitalised albeit for only one night (some Mothers day that was) I was exhausted for a very long time afterwards, for several months and well after the meds finished. I was off work sick approx 6 weeks. My poor mum had very sever broncho pneumonia on at least 5 occasions that we know of. she would need a couple of weeks hospitalization and the strongest antibiotics as an IV treatment for the duration of her stay. mums pneumonia was about as severe as you can get but even mine with only oral antibiotics and a one night admission left me washed out for months . 

I'm not overweight but feel when I do gain a few pounds it can impact on my breathing so I can appreciate what you are saying with regards to weight loss and exercise.  it's very difficult when you want to do it all but when activity can potentially exacerbate your condition.

can I ask if you have been given any steroids  or saline nasal spray as a treatment for the nasal drip symptoms ? j can get really bad sinus infections and I've got to stick to the sprays religiously as the nasal passages blocked can defo labour my breathing. ironically when at the hospital out patient my pulmonary function tests indicate my lungs are performing at 128% .very strange when you are feeling very low with your breathing at times.

please try not to be frightened of the asthma. easy to say I know just remember many of us on this forum have led normal full lives whilst living with asthma
It's better to get the checks done  to find out for sure and get the right treatment if needed .I'm now on a preventative inhaler called symbocort and a nightly asthma tablet called mongelukast. I only use the blue salbutamol when needed . sorry for all the info but just wanted to give you the full picture. take care ",positive,negative,

I am a 33 year old woman and I have had a chest infection for 2 weeks, on antibiotics...
My breathing was a little troublesome, which was normal for a chest infection, but over the last couple of days my breathing has become so very difficult I have been to casualty twice...
If I sit still and don't move or talk I am fine, but if I walk across the room, or try to have a conversation is such very hard hard work, I have to sit down panting away with my heart racing until I can catch my breath.  I was prescribed a Salbutamol inhaler which helps but only for a very short time, I am exceeding 30 puffs a day which is making me feel wooozzzy.  I was given 40mg of Prednisolone this morning and was wondering how long it takes to kick in??  I can't face another sleepness night wondering if I should call and ambulance or struggle on for a bit longer...
Is this the start of a lifetime of asthma for me, as it seems like a curse.  I do not smoke and i am slightly overweight.  The breathing is difficult blowing out as opposed to breathing in, like it is stuck in my lower throat.  My SATS were fine in hospital 95% o2 so wasn't having an 'attack' but it is so new to me.  Is it possible to have asthma temporarily?? Please help! :(","Hi, I think the steroids kick in pretty fast but if you're struggling don't put it off, I used to do that a lot, felt like was being a pest for calling an ambulance but the longer you leave it the more likely it is to get worse.

I wouldn't call it serious for me as I have only had one bad asthma attack before. I am also prone to what I thought were chest infections as I usually get one per year and I have also had three in three months. Lately my Dr says it isn't a chest infection and that it is a contracted breathing tube / air way (unsure of the jargon). To speed things up I am currently on a keto diet, each time I have a cheat meal, Chinese takeaway, Indian takeaway, perhaps a sandwich or something I start to get wheezy like when I think I have a chest infection. Last night I had a curry and could not breath this morning. Probably running at 50% breathing efficiency. I took my pink Fostair inhaler and it seemed to have fixed it.

Generally schools don't let children keep inhalers/medication on them, so if your granddaughter is struggling then they will be aware when she requests her blue inhaler. if she starts to really struggle then the school will probabaly take action and contact her mother and then hopefully the penny will drop for mum on the importance of the brown inhaler.

Every winter around January - February I get sick and have a lot of chest congestion &amp; coughing with phlegm. This year on day three of being sick I went to the emergency room after I had taken ibuprofen and my fever had gone up. They did a strep test &amp; throat culture since I was also having a sore throat. Those test were negative so they assumed I had the flu with no test, and told me to take ibuprofen &amp; that it should be gone by day 5-7. So on day 8 with a fever, chest congestion, a cough, &amp; pain when breathing I saw a doctor who did a flu test which was negative. We also did chest X-rays which determined pneumonia in both lungs. I had a shot of rocephin before leaving the office, then she sent me home with antibiotics (z pack) and an inhaler. Now I&#39;m on day 10, I woke up this morning with out a fever (finally).

Also said cough could last a few weeks. Not really bringing much up off chest and the little that&#39;s there isnt nasty looking. Suffer from rhinitis and post nasal drip too.

If you go to the medicines page on this website you will find the name of the inhaler you are using. Read the info and check what side effects it has. This should be on the leaflet in the box also, more on that than on here! If your problem is not listed, ask the pharmacist or the Doc/nurse who prescribed it. You may need a different one if it's not helping you. They need to know what effects it has anyway. I think Symbicort is a Steroid so you should be monitored by your GP's anyway.

I saw a doctor because I had difficulty breathing while exercising and the doctor suggested it was exercise induced asthma (prescribed inhaler). I never really took it seriously, because I thought maybe it was just from the smoking, and well, I just wasn't serious enough about quitting and such (didn't last long at all).

Fast forward 5 years or so to now. I've been smoke free for over 3 months, didn't have any problems with a cough after quitting. Started exercising and a calorie deficit perhaps 1.5 months after quitting (need to lose about 20kg) and it was okay. Found myself a little short of breath but nothing out of the ordinary for someone quitting I guess. After 2 months of pretty intense exercise, I've found my breathing getting more and more difficult, and now I have developed quite a wheezy cough. It starts during exercise and lasts through to the next day now.

Is it likely exercise induced asthma or something else because of my smoking history? I thought at over 3 months in my physical condition would be getting better, not worse? I also get a blocked nose all the time which makes things even more difficult, a problem I've yet to find a solution to.

I was put on Clenil 250mg (two puffs, twice daily) and given a Ventolin inhaler also. &#160;These seem to have made no difference after 2-3 months and in fact it has continued to get worse.

774,Good athlete but have had stamina problems since childhood.,/forums/discuss/good-athlete-but-have-had-stamina-problems-since-childhood--591800,7,Asthma,Good athlete but have had stamina problems since childhood.," Male, North America, 6&#39;3&quot; 200 lbs. athletic build, non-smoker.    I have always been a very good athlete. Baseball, basketball, football, etc. I was always the second fastest kid in school, in sprints. But, even in elementary school, i could not run with any sort of endurance. In the 70s, in (U.S.) elementary school, we had something called the President&#39;s Fitness Challenge or some such. Broadjump, 40-yard dash, etc. And there was a 600 yard run. I excelled at the other tasks, but in the 600 yard run, i finished near last, and essentially just kept up with &#39;the fat kid.&#39;&#160;    This persisted all my life. I did play on middle school basketball teams, but my performance suffered with each trip up and back down the court. I played football, well, but only because it consists of quick sprints and then recovery periods.    As a child, i never entertained the idea that this could be related to asthma. My naive concept of asthma was of the small, weak child who wheezed and had an inhaler. I didn&#39;t wheeze or cough. I don&#39;t think i experience something characterized as &quot;tightness in the chest.&quot; No pain. I simply get fatigued quickly with exercise and breathe very hard earlier than anyone else. I do sometimes have an odd issue where if i go very hard, for a while, in something sustained such as jogging, my hearing will &#39;go out&#39; in one of my ears. All the tubes are connected, right?! But, no real &#39;dry mouth&#39; or pain. Not sure what my heart rate is doing, but i don&#39;t recally feeling anything like &#39;palpatations.&#39; I think, knowing i have a heart murmur, if i experienced anything that felt &#39;heart-related&#39; i would be concerned on the spot, but it always feels like &#39;wind&#39; and muscle fatigue. &#160;    Currently, i try to play tennis. But, because i&#39;m so quickly exhausted, my footwork is never what it should be, so i do not improve. Again, even at age 49, it&#39;s not a tightness in the chest. No coughing at all. I just begin to breathe very heavily very quickly at the onset of exercise. I can walk forever. There seems to be some threshold of exertion that i pass that leads to this. I don&#39;t think i have any other lifestyle issues with stamina, though. I&#39;m not a &#39;high energy&#39; person, but i also don&#39;t ever feel tired when doing normal things any more than other people. Meaning that i don&#39;t leave social events early, i don&#39;t sleep early [b]—[/b] actually i sleep very little. End up going to sleep at 3-4am and waking at 8 or 9....&#160;    I skate [b]—[/b] rollerblade or roller-skate. Used to regularly (weekly) inline skate the 6 mile loop around Central Park. I was fast overall, but probably struggled more than &#39;normal, and only occasional skaters&#39; when climbing hills. I did find that i improved a bit from the first skate of the spring to the third or fourth, but still not much more beyond that. Now that i&#39;m only rollerskating, indoors, i do believe i tire more quickly than everyone else [b]—[/b] even people who are completely new and inexperienced, even though I am a regular (weekly).&#160;    * Other details: I have a heart murmur. Slight or mild, i think is how it was described from childhood. It was never supposed to be an issue. I have probably always been anemic, but i don&#39;t believe it was significant at childhood, because my sister was anemic, and that wasn&#39;t something i was described as at that point, but into adulthood, my diet doesn&#39;t contain a lot of vegetables, and i&#39;ve been tested as iron deficient/anemic for quite some time. I have tried iron supplements, but they aggravated my stomach until more recently when i found some that are better in that respect. Haven&#39;t been tested since i tried them, though. But, there has been no difference in my condition.    I joined a gym once, a few years ago. One year. Before joining, i thought maybe my &#39;endurance issues&#39; were because my legs were thin and weak and were overtaxed during exercise. But,&#160;I was pretty good at leg strength exercises which surprised me. But, i still couldn&#39;t do much in terms of endurance exercises. Never worked much on a treadmill, but i did try to do 10 minutes of elliptical work at a moderate pace. Never saw any improvement in my ability there.    * About 20 years ago, i tried to get tests done to find out if i had a heart problem. I had EKG(?) and a stress test performed. No negative results, although i do not remember specifics. About 10 years ago, i consulted a doctor about possible asthma. I was tested and had normal performance with lung capacity. I was still given an inhaler as a test, but saw no results. I think i was supposed to use it only before exercise. I tried it at the specified period before using the elliptical, but there was no change. Shortly afterward, i had a discussion with my mother, who disclosed she always had &#39;shortness of breath&#39; with exertion, even with simple household tasks. She consulted a doctor who prescribed an inhaler, but she was directed to use it once per day, regardless of expected activity. She said this helped her. Was my inhaler the wrong type? Was i instructed to use it inappropriately?&#160;    * A WEIRD THING? I’ve never smoked cigarettes. A few cigars, back in the 90s, but that was just ‘a thing.’ Never tried [b]marijuana[/b] until after i was 40, and in the handful of times since then that i have tried smoking ‘weed cigarettes’ or a friend’s vaping device, it was entirely without effect. I wonder if there’s something that prevents the vapor from penetrating? Which might also have prevented the asthma inhaler from working? Which might also explain why oxygen doesn’t fuel me as it should?    That&#39;s about it. Sorry for the length. Hope the detail helps.... "," Hi MardenMay,  There seems to be several things going on here, 1) have I got asthma, 2) what&#39;s normal 3) Heart Murmur.  I&#39;m not medical but I also suffer from low energy.  I have a heart murmur but it&#39;s very common and the hospital said my heart was perfect and to forget about it.  Comparing ourselves to other people is never a good idea in terms of getting out of breath, however have you got any digestive problems?  Apparently acid reflux can cause shortness of breath, have a look on the web under acid reflux and shortness of breath. In the meantime it seems to me as though you are quite sporty but I wonder how long you do something for before giving up?  I come across a lot of asthma sufferers who have forgotten how to use their inhalers but think they use them correctly.  Go to the chemist and get them to check if you are using it properly.  The preventer has to be used regularly and builds up over time and then there should be an improvement and the blue inhaler is for use before sport or whenever you feel short of breath.  I hope I&#39;ve helped a little.  ",neutral,,

They are exactly the same composition as say the Montelukast you refer to.

 ","Hello, yes i have and still do if i haven't used a Ventolin inhailer for a while then use it.

Feel shaky, not with it - feel i can't concentrait and fully understand what is being said to me, or what I'm talking about.  Can also feel adgitated and restless.  To prevent that I take a small dose, one small puff, as soon as I feel I need it and a larger 2 puff dose a little later.   

I try not to use the inhailer just before going to bed as it tends to keep me awake, have a small dose early if you feel you may need it before going to bed.  Also, try not to worry that you may need it at bed time as I have found you will do if you think about it.  The best way to overcome this, I have found, is to ask your doctor for Mogadon and take half a tablet in the evening an hour or half an hour before bed if possible.  This will help you relax, don't take Mogadon every night as you will need to increase the dose, taken now and then prior to bed time it can help you relax and prevent the need to use the inhailer or prevent an asthma attack!

If i use the inhailer during the night I get a little restless then fall into a deep sleep and can oversleep.  Funny old things the inhailers, very thankful for them.

Please be careful not to overuse,  I have overused and ended in hospital!  Having taken the usual dose and found after 20 - 30 mins it has not worked i took more and still didn't work.  I got worse and worse so took another couple of puffs.  Ambulance was called and I was taken to hospital and put on a nebulizer.

I&#39;m fairly new to asthma, being diagnosed with it only a year ago. It was manageable until a few days ago. I had to go to ER cause I couldn&#39;t stand it anymore and my rescue inhaler was only doing the minimal. The ER doc just listened to my lungs and said they sounded ok but gave me 40 mg prednisone and said to use my rescue inhaler (Ventolin HFA) until I see my PCP.    **Here are my questions:  (I&#39;d like to add that my asthma is due to allergies)**    1. Everytime I take a deep breath, I can hear mucus stuck in my lungs. Sometimes it can be coughed out (rare) but most of the time it&#39;s just in there. Is this part of asthma?    2. I don&#39;t cough very much. Here and there. Mainly after I have to use my inhaler a lot. Is that normal? I thought asthma made people cough?    3. I was given by my PCP a few months ago 2 different types of medicines. One is Singulair (oral pill) and the other is Arnuity Ellipta (inhalation powder). Have you tried either of these? I was going to start the Singulair tonight.    4. Is yours worse when lying down? I feel like everytime I lay down to try to sleep that it gets worse. At this point, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s anxiety or real symptoms or both.     And any other advice anyone would like to offer?? I would be so grateful.  I recently purchased an air purifier as I do have animals and one sleeps on a dog bed in my room and I know that&#39;s most of my problem is animal allergies.     Thank you!!! "," Hi! Singular is good for me ,ask Dr. For different rescue inhaler, because it sounds like your present on has a propellant that may be irritating and causing cough and and other yuck feelings , like headache. I have used many different ones, but Ventolin works best for me. Take your allergy meds or do allergy shots for dog dander etc.. yes, laying flat is not good. If the attack is severe you may have to sit up with pillows in your lap until meds start working and you can gradually lay back somewhat.  once you have had bad day or days you become super-sensitive to everything.  It is better to not clean and dust until you are clear, Don&#39;t raise the dust, then use moist cloths to dust and wipe floors. Don&#39;t mess with dog bed anytime.

sorry to hear your under the weather  it sounds as if you have a chest infection I it always seem to me to take a while for the antibiotics and steroids 2or days so hopefully you should soon start to feel better.
if not straight back to the doctors for him to check you out again. He may send you to hospital for further checks are you coughing up anything up if so be sure to tell your doctor I know how frightening a bad attack can be but at least you know that by using your ventolin you can control your attack, enough to get to hospital hope this helps

I've suffered from asthma and hayfever since I was a baby (I'm in my fifties now) but over the last few years the asthma had virtually dissapeared, until a couple of weeks ago.  A number of people have commeneted on me sounding out of breath and I'm having to use my ventolin sevaral times a day.  I was wondering if it might be down to the high polluion levels we've been hearing about in the news?  I hope it settles down soon as I have lots of other problems to deal with and don't this as well!

Any comments gratefully recived as I'm quite inexperienced in dealing with asthma having been free of it for so long

xxx","Dear Lizzie
Recently there have been some really serious warnings about the poor quality of air at the momemt, plus hayfever...
Sorry to hear you suffered from Asthma at such a young age.
Using your Ventolin appears to me to be a good decision at present and ensure you have an inhaler that is in date, if you have not been using one for sometime. 
A visit to your Practice nurse (who may specialise in such issues) or your GP would probably put your mind at ease.
I suffer from Brittle ASthma and normally have a rough time from Nov-Feb however I have to say I am on 8 prednisolone tablets today, as the quality of air/asthma is really affecting me. This is my top dose so it shows how bad the air quality is as far as I am concerned. I think you too are suffering because of poor air quality too, but do not let it go on unchecked by the medical profession if it continues.. 
Hope you feel better soon

861,Just sharing my first experience with ICU,/forums/discuss/just-sharing-my-first-experience-with-icu-587175,2,Asthma,Just sharing my first experience with ICU," So no one I know has asthma and I have no one to share this experience with. And I know many people go through worse but for me this was quite frightening. I&#39;m not sure I expect anyone to be concerned about reading this or replying, but I would love to hear some other&#39;s stories. So here we go..    I was admitted to the ICU due to my asthma attack, and for the first time ever, standard treatments just weren&#39;t cutting the backbone of the attack. (And it was my first time in an ICU.)   I was on the bipap for about 26 hours and I started using that to compensate for how much I couldn&#39;t breathe anymore due to the muscle strain around my chest, and clearly the doctors began realising that I was tiring.  The doctor sat next to my bed and said if my breathing didn&#39;t improve in the next 20 min or if it got any worse he&#39;d either go to giving me intravenous ketamine or intubation.     I was so scared because I first thought: &#39;Give me all the meds! I&#39;m not getting intubated!&#39;, then his second comment made me even more terrified as he said &#39;ketamine can cause hallucinations, vomiting and sometimes anger and agitation, so we&#39;re just in a bit of a difficult place about what to do next.&#39; I think it honestly made my breathing worse because the last thing I want is to be hallucinating in the ICU. And by that point I was thinking, &#39;Give me all the tubes!&#39; But he gave my a friendly pat on the head and said, &#39;but don&#39;t stress, we&#39;re the ICU and we only want to do the best for you, and we won&#39;t do anything without consulting your parents.&#39;  But it also made me think: is that even a standard procedure? I&#39;m also only 17 as well. I&#39;d understand if a patient was much older.  By this point I&#39;d already been given: tons of nebs through the bipap (which had salbutamol and atrovent), IV adrenaline, IV magnesium sulphate, IV potassium (because of the effects of salbutamol), IV prednisolone, my phosphates were dropping and my blood gases were quite far off norm. My blood pressure dropped to 79/30 as well. And my heart rate sat around 170. Basically I was ready to retire from breathing because I was so tired, but at the same time the bipap was compensating for the most part of what I couldn&#39;t do anymore.  The nurses spoke to me today (2 days later) about how they were all convinced I was going to be intubated. One of them even said she was low-key hoping I would be, out of sympathy, because it would&#39;ve given me sleep and my muscles a rest.     I&#39;m now out of the ICU and in the ward as of today.  I have 14 injection points of IV&#39;s in my wrists/hands because my veins and arteries were simply hopeless! They had to stitch some of them in because they kept falling out (or hopeless me accidentally ripping them out, but to be fair that only happened once). Even one of my vein collapsed! They had to use ultrasound imaging to gain access to my arteries because the procedure of putting in the IV blood pressure monitor was helplessly failing!     Anyway, probably a completely boring post, but I don&#39;t think there was anyone else to share my story with, and sometimes it&#39;s nice to share these things with people.  Hopefully there&#39;s some other stories y&#39;all have to share as well, because I&#39;d be interested to read some.

Feeling lost.," Hello Everyone,    &#160;    &#160; I wanted to post on the forum regarding what I have been struggling with for a little over a year now. I have talked about this with my physician multiple times and I have even seen a pulmonary specialist multiple times. The first time I went the doctor did not suspect anything wrong with me so he didn&#39;t want to order any tests but rather put me on a medication called Beru or Bero (Its an inhaler). I did the inhaler for two weeks without any improvement to my condition. So I asked him if we can perform a Pulmonary function test which he didn&#39;t think it was necessary but I wanted to do it so he ordered it and I will post the results with you. I also went to see an allergist/ENT doctor who said that I have a bit of a deviated area in my nose which is why he believes i might be wheezing through my nose. He also ran a spirometry test which I will post.&#160;    I should explain a little about myself and what I am currently dealing with cause this post is probably very confusing right now. I am currently a three year Firefighter/EMT about to start college for Nursing in two weeks and eventually work my way up to achieve my masters degree in Nurse Practitioner. For the past year and a half I have came down with a weird breathing issue that no doctor can seem to figure out which has me left in a corner without answers. Throughout the day I have this constant struggle of taking deep breaths. When I go to take a deep breaths I can complete it cause it feels like my lungs are hard and wont expand fully which cuts of the deep breath and leaves me very unsatisfied and left with a feeling of needing more air. Every now and then I will have a very very mild cough where it feels like I have ti cough but its not even like a cough but rather like a clear the throat kind of hack but thats it. Nothing comes up and I&#39;m not coughing up anything. I also get heart palpations really bad throughout the day but they go away and come back so its quite random. I would like to consider myself a very healthy individual and by that I mean I have never once did any drugs or picked up a cigarette. The only issue is growing up I was around second hand smoke due to my grandparents but my parents never smoked. Now working at the fire station I&#39;m around cleaning supplies that give off fumes, Dust, Fumes from the engines and of course second hand smoke from employees and smoke when we get fires. I try my best to avoid all these exposures but when the guys are barbecuing its really hard to avoid the smoke coming from the barbecue cause it gets into the station. I should also mention before I forgot that according to allergy test I am allergic to Dust, Trees, Grass and certain insects. I will also post these results.    My main concern with my pulmonary function test is my results are normal but at my age only being 23 years old I am worried that my results are not over the 100% mark and I&#39;m not understanding why cause a lot of people my age are. I feel like even though I am in the high 80’s and 90’s, I will decrease so quick and develop a terminal illness and I&#39;m worried. As you can see from my pulmonary function test graph at the bottom my graph coves in slightly and is it just me or does that not indicate an obstruction (slight).&#160;    I do not have any medical history other than my allergies. No lung issues run in my family that I am aware of. The only thing that I know that runs in my family is CHF, Diabetes, Hypertension, Alzheimer’s. I am not due for another pulmonary function test until 6 months from now so I&#39;m hoping nothing will decrease or if possible I&#39;m hoping something might increase but I doubt thats possible.&#160; &#160;    I also wanted to mention that for the past week I have been getting really uncomfortable heart palpations randomly throughout the day and it feels as if my chest or lungs feel sore and I am not sure if this is due to maybe taking deep breaths to try and catch my breaths cause they are getting cut off. Yesterday at work I was coughing a decent amount due to a tickle feeling in the back of my throat but that kinda went away. Now its just a very minor cough where it is very random. Another symptom I recently have been experiencing like crazy is my stomach feeling bloated all day even when I first wake up which makes me feel like maybe my diaphragm is pushed down into my stomach and is not working properly? I really have no idea and no Doctor can figure out a reason. I doubt I have congestive heart failure or any heart problems at 23 years old especially since I eat right and take care of myself but exercising routinely.&#160;    I want to apologize for the long post but I wanted to give as much info as possible and I really appreciate anyone who did read all of this. "," I can&#39;t provide you with an an exact asnwer to your problems but It&#39;s possible I might be able to give you a potential idea for investigation. To me those numbers and graphs&#160;looked excellent, but my lung function rarely gets above 68%, I only wish mine were that high.    I&#39;m going to suggest something here, based on what you&#39;ve said, the palpitations, the bloated feeling... the unexplained breathing problems, I&#39;m starting to wonder whether you might actually have a hiatus hernia. A hiatus hernia, can cause palpitations, a feeling of reduced ability to breath and&#160;reflux which can irritate the lungs somewhat and cause breathing issues (it can cause far more than that, it can mimic a lot of other complaints). Some people can have reflux without getting heart burn! ",neutral,,

I know you say above that she has no wheeze and she has cough variant asthma but I am a chronic asthmatic and I have had major attacks with no wheeze, I have been told that no wheeze can be caused by the fact that there is so much clogging in my lungs, that air is too limited to get through, and to be extra vigilant if I feel breathless and that occurs.  Sorry just saying but I assume they did an x-ray to rule out that her lungs were congested.

I’ve had a productive cough for nearly 10 months and my Dr’s are baffled on the cause. Other symptoms include sharp chest pains that come and go, what I call heavy breathing (not panting, but a slow/heavy inhale) and a cough that contains a sticky mucus that is mostly thick and white or clear in color. All of these are intermittent and can be severe to barly noticeable. 

I’ve had many tests done including: Lung function, Chest CT with contrast, throat scope, X-rays and blood work. They found a small node (7mm I believe) that was favored to be post inflammatory in one lung. I’m scheduled to have another in a 10 or so months. The scope showed evidence of GERD, but I’ve been using Zantac and Prilosec daily for over a month now without any relief. 

The longer this lunges on without a diagnoses the more I continue to worry. Anxiety certainly cannot be helping my cause at all.

I suffer from panic attacks Also and a lot of the time I have panic attacks because I'm scared to have an asthma attack, I have my peak flow meter so I can know how good or bad my breathing is but even if it's just a little below usual I find myself trying to keep blowing to get a higher result and if I don't i panic then I struggle to breathe, It's hard sometimes to differentiate between the two and I often feel like they both set the other off? Sorry this is my first post, never spoken to anyone about my asthma before other than doctors so I hope this makes sense? 
So guess I'm asking if anyone else struggles like this? X ","Hi, sorry to hear you are having a rough time with your Asthma, my own was only diagnosed about 4 years ago (about age 47) after a couple of years of various breathing issues. Once diagnosedan treated it was v stable.  Until last September that is when i had 3 a 4 chest infections incl. pneumonia which knocked me sideways.

my GP referred me to respiratory specialist consultant who diagnosed acute Asthma and Eosinophilia, and we appear to have it on the back foot after 12 months constantly adjusting medication, plus getting a lot more exercise and losing a few kG has helped a great deal, using a gym helps me a great deal.

dont let your PF measurements stress you, sounds a bit like some anxiety issue, which i can understand, just do 2 measurements and record both for your Dr, chart your best results AM and PM.

i now take much better care of myself, exercise and diet wise, but also I see my GP straight away if i suspect i may hace an infection again.  My breathing difficlties last year scared the daylights out of me, being a non smoker and needing a nebuliser to breath is v scary as i am sure you know too well

The thought of another attack keeps me focused on changing my diet / exercise and general lifestyle together with the medications to help fight asthma as best i can.

She wanted me to ask if any of you experience coughing after eating or drinking.  My Mom said she can take just a sip of water or eat one or two bites and start coughing and it takes a long time to get her throat clear afterwards. It does not seem to be a sensitive area of her throat and she does not experience the trouble breathing that another member described here.  She has been checked by an ENT doc and they did a swallow test that did not result in any findings. She has also been  tested for gerds and acid reflux and does not have either one. 

Just wondering if eating or drinking causes things to be worse for anyone else here. 
Thanks,
Katherine","Hi Katherine! You’ve come to right place for help and support. Yes, I also seem to struggle with frequent choking when I eat or drink. I do OK as long as I concentrate and take small bites. I do have GERD. Just had upper and lower GI checked, and he stretched my esophagus a little because of my complaint with this problem, even though he didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. Has maybe helped a little. I just always have water at the ready when I eat. So sorry it has taken so long to diagnose your Mom. Hopefully they’ll begin culturing her sputum so they can prescribe antibiotics specific to her needs if/when she has an exacerbation. Prayers for you, and all of us.",positive,positive,

111,Am I seeing my first deterioration?,/forums/discuss/am-i-seeing-my-first-deterioration--708278,18,Bronchitis,Am I seeing my first deterioration?,"Hi,

I was diagnosed with Bx around 2014  after noticing an usual 'lack of bhp' when climbing a hill on my mountain bike. Since then, I've just had a crackle noticeable at night - especially when lying on my left side. That is until I started with an annoying cough which began around mid-June and has stayed with me for 6 weeks so far with no improvement despite courses if Amoxicillin, Clarithromycin and now Doxycycline.

I had a chest x-ray mid-April due to a temporary bout of dyspnea, this was clear. I had a further chest x-ray in early July which showed inflammation and atelectasis in the left lung. The routine GP appointment concluded it was an infection and I should try Doxycycline.

In the last week, I've developed central and lower back ache and the cough seems a little drier and weaker sounding (clear mucus less frequent). Strangely, I seem to breathe better when led down and I don't cough until I'm up and about in the morning.

As a father of twin 4-year-old girls, I'm less blasé about my health these days and I'm worried this could be something serious as Bx hasn't massively  affected me to date.

Can anyone relate to these symptoms and perhaps put me at ease? I'm a life-long non-smoker and I don't recall much if any exposure to asbestos. My lungs don't get a work out these days as parenthood has temporarily put a stop to my cycling hobby!","Hi there
I was diagnosed with BX when I was 8. I'm now 51 and spent most of my life having infections and in and out of hospital but one thing I have always done is exercised. I have slowed down now compared to what I used to do but still remain active which isnt bad considering I have around 4 to 6 lots of ivs (intravenous antibiotics) File size is too biga year plus oral antibiotics. My advise is send frequent sputum samples off to see if you have an infection sometimes your body can become immune to them. Also get an aerobika breathing device which helps you get any mucus off the lungs. Take turmeric & black pepper capsules, high strength manuka honey and eat well. I cough during the night and when I sit up in the mornings I'm guessing sitting up means your moving the mucus about as you have been laying down all night. Both of my lungs are damaged through Bx but I still lead a full and busy life apart from when I have an Infection then I rest up until I'm well again. Do you live in the UK?

I have given up running and heavy lifting, but cannot eliminate the single biggest risk factor, i.e. the daily coughing.&#160;    Whenever I do my chest clearance I try to tighten my pelvic floor muscles (&quot;the knack&quot;), but there is still a lot of pressure everytime I cough. So I am trying to minimise the coughing during chest clearance - but so far without much success. I take mucolytics to thin the mucus, which makes it a little easier, but still cough a lot. The Brompton phsyio suggested adapting the AD technique so I don&#39;t bring up too much mucus in one go, but it still happens :-(&#160;    In a forum somewhere someone mentioned they were using a Yoga breathing technique that enabled them to clear their chests without anyone noticing - sounded like they managed to bring up the mucus without coughing (though they must then have swallowed it, which I am not planning to do!!).

Once a month though I dose myself up with anti-inflammatories and set a trail for a hash house harriers group of joggers/runners/walkers that I run in my local area of Thailand. That involves me walking typically 2 hrs and 8km.

For a long time (particularly the past 2 years) she has been getting frequent chest infections and been treated with 1 week courses of antibiotics and steriods. After finishing a course she would be ok for a week, by the end of that week her symptoms would return and she would need antibiotics and steriods again.

Thanks"," I would go see my GP (that&#39;s a &#39;general practitioner&#39; - ie equivalent to MD in the US -&#160; for any non-Brit loooking in) in your situation and insist on being referred to a pulmonologist. BronchX is a chronic disease and you are entitled to specialist monitoring. If your GP does not agree to do so for no good reason tell her/him that you want to take that up through whatever appeal processes the practice has or through the &#39;NHS complaints procedure&#39; (google the words I put in quotes) - I&#39;m sure it will not come to that if you are polite but firm in your request to your GP    I distrust the statement that &#39;weakness and tiredness cannot be due to your BronchX as you do not get infections&#39;. Like others on here I often get periods of tiredness and ocassionally exhaustion even though I do not have a full-on infection at the time (and I only get two or three exacerbations per annum anyway - which are usually quickly despatched by a few days of increased antibis).    Tiredness can be caused by reduced oxygen flow (due to restrictions / inflammation / damage to the airways) and/or by the onset of minor infection that your immune system is successfully fighting off and which does not present as an exacerbation.    Tip - when you do get a wave of tiredness try either or both of getting up and walking around briskly for ten minutes or 10 mins of deep &#39;belly breathing&#39; (raising your diaohragm up and down). I figured this would correct for any reduced oxygen flow which might be contributing to (or wholly causing) my tiredness &#39;attacks&#39;. Be careful with deep breathing though - it can make you feel faint if you overdo it. Do it sitting upright in a hard backed chair rather than lounging in a sofa and particularly not doing very strong breathing when standing up (for fear of fainting/falling). I&#39;m not a medic and have not been advised to do this type of response work by any medic - I worked it out for myself and it often seems to clear my tiredness or at least bring it under control. would be interested if it works for other people, though I guess that I should be advising people to try it only after talking it through with a doctor particularly if you have breathing or heart issues ",neutral,neutral,

Welcome to this site.
I am new to bronchiectasis, diagnosed in May this year.  Personally, I am still coming to terms with having it! 
I had been ill from Sept 2014 to March 2015, constant chest infections, lots of pain in chest/shoulder and was told x-rays were all clear. I finally had a ct scan which showed bronchiectasis middle and lower lobes of right lung.  My symptoms vary day to day, some days exhausted with a tight chest other days its more manageable.
The best thing for me in ""controlling"" things is regular clearance, lots of water and cutting down on dairy.  I also take vitamins, preobotic tablets as suffer with indigestion now which causes pain in chest/shoulder! I also have smaller meals as my body copes with food better.
I have read so much about bronchiectasis (knowledge is good!) and decided that I had to get some control with it.   I have seen a respiratory consultant, had two sessions with a physio who showed me how to use my accapella device, which helps with my breathing issues.  I also have antibiotics at home which I can start immediately I think I have an infection.  I also have sputum pots at home to ensure I get a sample into the docs immediately.  
You are really going thro it and do hope things improve for you very soon.  Did they say what your severe pain was? Where are you at with seeing a resp consultant, physio etc? What other support have you been offered?
There are lots of wonderful people on this site who have helped me so much with answers to my questions. x",positive,neutral,

I&#39;m in the States so am unfamiliar with some of those work references, but I understand how terrified you must be about possibly losing your job.

And he ran like a CBC and anemia panel and inflammation panel. the chest x-ray  was where I'm a little confused. he said that my lungs were not fully inflating with air so his suggestion was for me to breathe deeply. he is a very conservative doctor and as much as I appreciate that I find that that treatment is a bit, well ridiculous.

I had not been running a fever and everything I could get up which at the time was pretty minimal was clear. he treated the infection with augmentin and between that and my breathing treatments I was golden. that was back around June or July 2018. since that time I have had a couple of infections that were very obvious and again Augmentin saved the day.

I've been poorly for quite a long time. this bout anyway, which seemed to be my asthma out of control, I still have BX of course.
During October I was prescribed Septrin a daily antibiotic. As far as I knew I didn't have any side effects. But I seemed to be going from one course of prednisolone to the next because of breathing difficulties. 
I kept seeing the GP who wasn't much help and finally put me on a graduated dose of steroids...coming down 1mg every 3 days. That would have meant I wouldn't finish this course until almost the end of February. I wasn't prepared to do that!! 
I started wondering if the Septrin was causing me 'breathlessness'? I checked the side affects...yes was possible so I rang my pharmacist (Saturday afternoon) and she suggested I stopped it for 48hrs and also monitored my peak flow...it was a poorly 150 at that time. 
Almost immediately I noticed the difference and my peak flow increased to 200.
I also had another 'light bulb' moment. My asthma has always been allergy related so I started taking a daily antihistamine again.  (I'd stopped taking them back in 2016 when a nutritionist wanted a blood test, I didn't restart them and shortly afterwards was diagnosed with BX.)

I can't tell you all how different my breathing is now....peak flow 250, 8 days off Septrin and 5 days with an antihistamine.  I altered the dose of the prednisolone to down 5mg every 3 days so am due to finish those on Tuesday. 
I know my consultant won't have a problem with any of this self discovery and altering the meds around. The GP would be an entirely different matter...LOL. ","That's fantastic, Janet!",positive,negative,

Having spent a lifetime intermittently on steroids of various sorts for various conditions the side effects for me are similar

beyond helping the condition that needed them, often works best on the cusp of finishing them it gives great creativity, the best ideas of my working life, energy and clarity of thought

cons
insomnia, easy to lose temper, impatience, upset stomach, hunger,  weight gain, skin problems.

last year I had a new steroid and took it for nearly a year to avoid brain swelling after neurosurgery. I think it worked but had most of the side effects.

My conclusion was that you are stuck with the side effects to get the undoubted benefits. Finally only to be taken under close medical supervision.

"," I use a lot of things to get mine out, but I gotta ask:  who said that lying down with hips elevated would loosen the stuff &amp; bring it up?  Long before I met my current pulmo I knew from experience  that lying down on my back, then switching to either side for a while, could help get up gunk, and that lying down on my stomach -a position I can&#39;t do for long, was most helpful.  This rotation/change of positions turns out to be used quite a lot in the fine art of lung pounding.  My current  pulmo would add that AFTER getting the stuff loosened up, one should lie down on one&#39;s stomach with the head hanging off the edge of the bed, tho not so long as to cause any problems.  On a good day I can do that a few minutes.    Mostly  I don&#39;t have to do that.  Take some mucus thinners.  My doc has me on 1200mg of plain guafenisin twice daily, drinking 8 oz of water each time plus tons o water throughout the day.  I use nebulizer treatments to get most of my lung meds &amp; they also help loosen things up.

Heart rate is rising. I asked how unpleasant the procedure was, &#39;not very pleasant&#39; ...HEART rate goes up again.  Im taken through to the ward, given a robe , had a cannula inserted and told I just had to wait for the doctor. I enquired whether it would be the surgeon I know and trust as had been agreed. The nurse checked, and said no, a junior doctor would be carrying the procedure out....Heart rate pounding now.  The said doctor turned up, very pleasant, &quot; is there anything you want to ask&quot;...i asked why my own surgeon wasnt doing it, to be told he was away all week. I explained i was agitated and had specifically asked for him to do it, which he agreed via emails, which were in my files there.  I was asked if i wished to postpone it, I said no, Im here, cannula in, lets just do it.  I was taking into the theatre, put on the bed, given a rather spiteful injection in my trachea, which was not pleasant at all, followed by throat spray.  I was then given my 1st &#39;coctail &#39; ....felt nothing.

I don&#39;t smoke and I rarely drink (couple of times a month). Here is what I&#39;m dealing with    09/30/2017 (I remember because it was my best friends wedding). I started feeling like I had a cold, ie: coughing, shortness of breath, lowgrade fevers. It wasn&#39;t overwhelming, but the symptoms were present daily.    Beginning of November, I go to a prompt care as my shortness of breath slightly worsened, ie: I would start coughing if I began laughing. They gave me some beginner level steroids (sadly I don&#39;t recall what) and took an x-ray. The X-ray showed a very small patch in the right part of my long which is what they used to diagnose the walking pneumonia.    Beginning of December, the steroids helped a little. I wasn&#39;t coughing when laughing/talking, but I did still have a slight chronic cough and still the occasional shortness of breath or low-grade fever. Since the symptoms were still happening, I went to my actual physician, who took another x-ray. The patch was gone, but she said my sinuses were rather red/inflamed. She stated it could likely be sinusitis. She gave me even stronger steroids and I seemed to mostly get better.    Beginning of January, I felt about 95%, but over the next week or two, the chronic cough began to come back and the occasional shortness of breath came back. Since then I&#39;ve gone back to my physician (beginning of February). This time we tried saline water, flonase, and Loratadine in case it was due to post nasal drip.    Here we are tonight. The post nasal drip treatment hasn&#39;t worked. Still to this point, they symptoms aren&#39;t stopping me from living my life, ie: I work 40-50 hours a week, go to the gym 3-4 times a week (I do have some weight to lose), socialize with my friends, etc. I haven&#39;t noticed anything that triggers the chronic cough &amp; shortness of breath. For example, my workout tonight was a little over an hour and I felt fine during the whole thing. I&#39;m just at this point where I&#39;m more worried about the length that this has been going on rather than the symptoms themselves. Any thoughts? "," Oh boy.    You&#39;re basically describing what I went through after having pneumonia in 1996. I had symptoms like yours for a year and a half, before being diagnosed with chronic bronchitis. A few months later in mid-1998, I was hospitalized for coughing up blood...turned out what I actually had was a fungal infection, pulmonary histoplasmosis. It took three weeks in the hospital and two years of meds to get things even remotely close to better (I ended up with a lot of lung damage due to the severity of the infection, and now I have bronchiectasis).    So, my thoughts: go back to your doctor and discuss getting checked for a fungal infection--there are several that affect the lungs--or, really, signs of any infection that might just be lingering in there.

I’ve used both of these devices. Personally, I found the flutter reached deeper inside, loosening the mucus a little more. However, you have to be in an upright position to use the flutter.

THANKS  GUYS , and stay well ! ","Hi Bricklayer
Diagnosed about 7 years ago, I too was told that I have a mild form of bronchiectasis and, like you, I'm fortunate in that the condition hasn't affected my life too much. I've probably had a few more chest infections in the past 5 years than you however, and am plagued by a cough that comes and goes. I'm assuming that a diagnosis of bronchiectasis, even if mild, makes us more 'at risk' than most and so I've been perhaps more careful than some to avoid contact with people (ie. the 2 metre rule) over the last 10 days or so and to hand-wash repeatedly. Age will also affect where on the 'at risk' scale we appear as well (I'm 63).

My name is Amber and I am currently a Respiratory Therapy Student in Georgia. I am approaching the last 2 terms of my path and have been given a simple project. For this project; I need you to tell me what you would like your therapist to know about you and your condition.
 
I would like to know these things without it being a project because I believe that not only the condition and/ or disease must be treated but also the patient. Each one of us is unique and experiences something different. I would like to know what you experience on a day to day basis and how you have learned to live with Bronchiectasis.

I want to be the best therapist I possibly can so I am asking for personal insight from all you. Please do not include any identifying information because I respect your privacy as I would wish mine to be. I would not and will not give any advice as your doctor and current respiratory therapist would know better than I, and my level of expertise/ experience is not something I would be comfortable with. I am a student, and as a student I must learn, and the best teachers are the people that experience these difficulties on a daily basis.

I’m 69 years old and have only dealt with BX for a little over a year now. I’ve been told that my case is mild, for which I’m very grateful. I’m fortunate to have an outstanding medical team. The one thing I value most in addition to great medical care is an understanding and support for the emotional issues that surround this disease. I’ve learned (mostly from this forum) that many folks struggle with much more severe symptoms than I do and I find myself experiencing some irrational fears at times. I’ve never really had trouble catching my breath but I do worry about it happening. I also deal with many other unfounded fears at times. It’s important to me that my medical team not minimize those feelings, no matter how irrational they may be.

That’s about all I have to offer. Hope it helps and I wish you the best in your career!

After years of chest infections and an almost continuous cough, I was finally diagnosed with Bronchiectasis yesterday.

In a strange way I’m glad to find out that there’s actually something wrong with me! 

Apart from feeling ill ill a lot of the time, I’ve found the last couple of years so embarrassing. Lost count of the number of times I’ve had to cancel arrangements as I’ve yet another chest infection. I’ve had to walk out at two weddings, grandsons nativity play, a funeral and the cinema, due to coughing non stop.

Am interested to know if anyone has found coughing has lead to incontinence. I’m 56, had three kids and have had to resort to buying tenna ladies pants! I saw my doctor about it, but was just told to do pelvic floor exercises. It’s only when I’ve got a chest infection this happens, but it’s most embarrassing and made me very depressed.

They have no idea how I came to have Bronchiectasis and have said it’s idiopathic. The only possible reason could be down to having glandular fever badly when I was 17.

Ive been referred for physiotherapy to learn how to cough up mucus, but have read up on techniques and hopefully this will help.

I had never heard of Bronchiectasis until yesterday, and came across this group. Obviously it effects a lot of people. I’ve read loads of the posts on here and found it really helpful."," Hi Vickylou    I missed what I call The Wedding of The Century one year ago, and trips to Montreal and the coast in this last year.  It sucks!  But once they get your infection under control &amp; have you on good meds, perhaps you&#39;ll be coughing less and life will get easier.  After 8-10 months of being sick, I thought I&#39;d never feel better again.  Thank goodness I was wrong.  I hope the same happens for you.    Many many women without any lung disease &quot;go&quot; a bit when they cough (or laugh).  It&#39;s more common among women who&#39;ve had several children than among childless women like me, but it even happened to a friend in 9th grade who&#39;d never had sex.  It also happens to my teen goddaughter, and she&#39;s been doing ballet since she was 6 so clearly has pretty toned muscles.  Some women are more prone.  I hope the exercises help.  Here in the States those special pants are expensive.     It&#39;s understandable to feel some relief with a diagnosis.  It gives us a name to share with friends, tho I&#39;ve learned to tell them that this is the only disease which Google  (erroneously) thinks is less dangerous than stating at a wall for 5 minutes.  But a diagnosis also tells us what we don&#39;t have, such as tb or cancer.   And for that we can be both relieved and thankful.    Hope you feel better soon. ",positive,positive,

Please forgive my curiosity - I'm newish to this lung disease (as I've only recently begun showing it respect after 5 symptom-free years).
I wouldn't say I'm short of breath, but i wheeze more now and have a chronic cough, producing thin clear frothy mucus with every cough and it's frankly relentless - after 'enjoying' 5 years with just rales at night and extra mucus only when working out on my bike (no cough). After a sputum test coming back 'satisfactory', I'm impatiently awaiting a consultation in late October with a cough specialist, and part of me is wondering what I should be doing in the meantime to prevent further damage. Seems as if antibiotics wouldn't help given the fact that no bugs were found in the sputum.

I would just like to hear other's stories as to what symptoms they began with and how long it was before a change.........and how you coped / combated the disease.

Thanks in advance for your wisdom.
","I have 4 lung diseases including brochiectasis, the cough WAS relentless, I am on prednisolone (steroid) and that has help enormously with the cough, was on 2 1/2 mg per day but as my diseases (three cause coughing) march steadily on I have had to up it until I am now on 10mgs, I also take a cough syrup routinely at night, here called Bronchokod (here in France) rarely wake up coughing now, I also sleep on a wedge pillow, helps with the acid reflux and keeps the phlegm down so less urge to cough. 
I really cannot give you any advice on how long to decline or what to do as I have probably had the bronchiectatis since teenage years, way into pensionable age now, had a lot of lung infections then. Is it getting any worse? no idea, probably not, as the others have speeded up badly, on oxygen now, 18 months after diagnosis.",neutral,neutral,

Was sufficiently interested to read it up a bit on the internet.&#160;    Google has loads of answers and notes that klebsiella infection treatment is &quot;discrepant&quot;, which I think - having searched online dictionaries - means it reacts inconsistently from one person to another (and maybe in the same person from one infection to the next) which rather suggests one person&#39;s good experience with a specific antibi is likely to be of little use as a generic recommendation for you. Reading between the lines it looks as though medics have to do a bit of trial and error with a patient presenting with such an infection.    I have had there pneumonia outbreaks - one at 13, which nearly killed me apparently and all I know is that the doctor was relieved to find me out of febrile danger (can still recall the halucinatory deeply feverish night 50 years later) in the morning having injected me with &quot;penecillin&quot; - that&#39;s all he told my mother apparently - presumably an early stage antibi. My two bronchX related pneumonias were caught relatively early&#160;and I started to recover from the first almost as soon as the first levafloxacin tablet had hit my system. My second was a bit deeper but I was out of hospital in three days having been IV&#39;d in Thailand (by a generalist infections consultant) with ceftazidime, which I see is one of the recommended potential treatments for klebsiella. My Thai Bangkok leading pulmonologist who specialises in bronchX (old and wise - says he used to train all Thai medics in the disease) expressed surprise that my local regional hospital had used this drug as combined experience of Thai pulmos was that it had run out of efficacy in bronchX patients in Thailand (efficacy can be country or region specific apparently) and its use for such had been stopped in Thailand a few years previous; he wasn&#39;t critical though - said it&#39;s possible that it has recovered efficacy and &#39;don&#39;t knock it if it worked!

The consultant was very good and explained what the disease was and then dropped the bombshell that there was no cure! 
However he went on to say that it was treatable and I have been on a regular regime of steroid inhaler, daily postural drainage, physiotherapy and oxgen therapy ever since i.e. for the last four years.
In addition to this he has also placed me on a short three day course of anti-biotics every month for life, to help minimise the risk of chest infections.
Whilst I still get breathless during exercise and still cough a lot and still  tire easily, I am far less prone to infections than I used to be.
The thing I have found most annoying is the attitude expressed in some quarters towards bronchiectasis. For example I have seen it described on some web sites as just a 'embarassing' disease because of the phlegm coughed up. To those of us who suffer from the disease it is far more than this. It is dibilitating and can have a major impact on our quality of life.","Hi Paul,

I am sorry that you were diagnosed with Bronchiectasis.  But you seem to be managing it extremely well.  I too am on antibiotics for three days a week (Azithromycin). Unfortunately I haven't been able to trial it properly yet because since December, members of my family keep bringing home colds and I keep catching them.  But I can give if a fair trial during the summer months.

I was talking to someone at the British Lung Foundation the other day and we were saying exactly what you have said.  Mention Emphasema or asthma and people nod and know what you are talking about.  Mention bronchiectasis and they look at you blankly.  Most people think it is just a bad bout of bronchitis they don't realise it is a chronic lung disease which does alter out quality of life.

I cannot doe postural drainage because of the damage to my lungs, but I do have oxygen.  How often do you use your oxygen or are you on it all the time?

Take care

i would listen to your pulmonologist.
it is so important to get your immune system up to snuff. then the next thing is to keep your lungs clear. ask about how to get mucus out of your lungs daily. nebulizing saline etc. it helps bring up mucus that if
left in your bronchiestasis can become infected and make u sick.
its important to have a good healthy diet and to continue being physically active..

Anxiety releases adrenalin and this in turn constricts the bronchioles and bronchi (the tubes) which of course will cause you to have difficulty  breathing with a tight chest. The mental health team may help you to contol your anxiety(if you have anxiety) by teaching you how not to panic and relax.For now just try to take a deep breath and hold it for 5 seconds and breathe out slowly.It is difficult coming to terms with a condition that (if you have read information) is lifelong.I have had this condition for 50 years since I had measles as a child.It still frightens me sometimes but I was once met a chap in his 80's which helped me to understand that if managed you can live a long and useful life.I have worked in the health service full-time as a nurse with no sickness for this condition.I have a productive cough and I have a box of amoxicilin at home which I use probably once a year.I do not do physio but do cough and clear my lungs.Perhaps I am lucky that my bronchiectasis only affects my left lower lobe.

I wonder what is life expectancy with these things. In the almost 3 years I have been diagnosed my body has deteriorated in a scary way. I used to work out hard daily. I worked a full time AND part time job simultaniously with not a day off for over a year. I have changed so drastically I cannot help but wonder (and fear). I feel that if I had not been so strong before this I would have died about 1 1/2 years ago. I now go up 3 steps and rest. Walk like I&#39;m 90 when I am 50. Out of breath often and miss out on so much. It is hard to keep positive when you can&#39;t ignore bad lungs. I know you all can relate. I think it&#39;s the pseudamonas that is the big problem.

While here there are group sessions one attends and one of them is all about stress and how it effects our breathing. It can become a vicious cycle, so when you feel yourself getting to this point, try to stop what ever you are doing to calm your breathing.

I may have asked this before but....
I have had B for years and been through varying phases with it. Currently no infection for 3 months..a miracle.
In the last 4/5 years of the condition I have experienced varying degrees of fatigue when infections take hold. The episodes go from debilitating where I have little or no energy, constant nausea and any kind of physical activity brings on a consequence to low level fatigue whereby you know its there but can generally get on.
I have dealt with my consultant across a couple of years who has essentially given up and was about to press the long term antibiotics button. I have a referral for The Royal Brompton in London. The appointments take about 4 months and I suspect that I may be well by the time it arrives.
My question is to all of you.
If you experience fatigue to whatever degree 
a) is it recognised by medics as a apart of your condition? Or ignored
b) has anyone one been offered any treatment /advice on mamagement or been referred to a specialist?
Last year with constant infections and fatigue I became realy mentally low with it all - a round of counselling helped but I would like to know about your specific experiences with this issue. I definitly notice the fatigue in correlation to my B health.
Thank you in advance to anyone that is able to reply.

Yes, both lung issues and heart issues can cause breathlessness.  My only experience is in the States with my significant other who had both.  With him, none of the specialists/ docs ever considered the possibility that heart disease might be affecting his breathing.  Nor did they ever touch upon hardening of the arteries at all, assuming that more oxygen was the only possible solution to his dizziness; hardening of the arteries was sole cause of death per the coroner.

I mention this because you may have to be the one to push docs/specialists/consultants to work together.

I have a very complicated story. I am female, 29 years old. Been diagnosed when I was 24, after a serious of wrong diagnosis and “bronchial asthma” since 2010 (only lately I found out I never had asthma).

Then my condition was getting worse, my pulmo changed meds, but nothing seemed to help. Asthma flare ups got more freaquent, mecidine - less effective every time. I was about to give up... but then I decided to change my pulmo. She immediately said I had no asthma as my tests were not showing it. She did a bronchoscopy, a CT scan and got my diagnosis - mild bronchiectasis. But it was weird then - she said there was nothing I could do, just try not to get ill??? I decided to change doctors again.

I found this surgeon, a professor that specialoze in BX. I contacted him and asked for help. Also, I read surgery sometimes is an option. So the professor took me in, performed another bronchoscopy (as, according to him, the previous one was not done properly), washed my lungs and confirmed I had a super mild case of BX. He urged me to get off all of the meds as they were not needed and go back to him in case my lungs start bothering me again.

So I lived my life for 5 years. Had no chest infections since 2013! Got flu or cold a few times a year, but never anything in my chest. Felt healthy! In spring of2017 went to the surgeon again, he checked my lungs and said everything is perfect! Until...

Until December 2017. I developed cold and started coughing. My GP diagnosed me with bronchitis. I panicked. Did it mean my BX came back??? After a few weeks of coughing and not being able to live my normal active life, I visited the surgeon again. He did bronchoscopy, CT scan and this is where it got weird.

The radiologist whp performed the scan wrote: no abnomalies, no BX in both lungs. My surgeon said: she just probably missed it. So I decided to see another doctor. I found this lung professor, showed him my tests, CT scan, he said: no, no bronchiectasis. So weird! I went to the surgeon again, bu he said: no, I see a very mild case!


So I decided to get a 3rd opinion. As I needed to know how to live my life: like I have BX or like I don’t. So I went to a 3rd professor, also a surgeon, but in my country it seems like surgeons know about this disease better! Weird also, but some of the pulmos I tried did not even know BX! Or how to treat it! Anyways, this 3rd professor looked at my tests, I went to him because he is the best in my country and he was recommended by other BX suferers. He said I have some changes in my lower lobes that could be considered as very mild BX. Also, that I probably had it since childhood and I have not yet developed a so called bronchiectasis disease. Basically, as he explained, changes my lungs are so little that they should not be a big problem for me, this is why I had not had an infection for 5 years. It just means I have  a weak spot and I should keep in mind not to run in winter time, etc. And that I shouldn’t worry, as this kind of BX is not prone to progress. I was so happy! I finally started sleeping at night. Weeks passed and my lingering cough went away, my health was perfect again. BUT

Last week I got flu, 39•C, really bad case! Of course it went to my lungs... my GP prescribed me anthibiotics again as she suspected another bronchitis. I want to her after 4 days, she said my lungs are clear and the caugh is from sinusitis. And I got really confused.

Was it sinusitis? Or was it so called flare up? But if, according to docs my BX is so mild, how come I got second bronchitis in 2-3 months? I am really confused. And depressed. I feel like this time it’s not going away and I am stuck to feeling like this for the rest of my life. Is it possible my BX progressed in only 2-3 months?

I know my story might seem weird, but I am really scared. I think of the worst possible scenarios. And I get down and feel alone.


Sorry for my long post. I hope you all are feeling better than I do."," Hi,    Please don&#39;t worry :)  Sinusitis is very common and nothing to worry about. You might have mild allergies - many of us do - and this causes the sinus infection, which normally clears up on its own and no antibiotics are needed.

So after having multiple spontaneous pneumothorax on my right and left lung I had VAT pleurodesis on both of my lungs. My right lung was done last December, everything was ok until August, in which I had a slight pneumothorax. After seeing the doctor it seemed that it was relatively small (3cm) and that it would cure itself. Apparently the upper part of the lung is not attached well together compared to the lower part. The doctor told me that, if this occurred more than twice per year, it would be a good idea to do pleurectomy, the more invasive version of pleurodesis. 

I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience, i.e. further pneumothorax after VAT pleurodesis. Did you get another pleurodesis or did you get a pleurectomy (which my doctor seemed to recommend). If so how did it compare, and how are you now?

I came here to talk about my experience with spontaneous pneumothorax and VATS surgery and maybe hear some feedback from you guys. I didn't really try sharing my story with fellow sufferers of this condition until now, but I've had my share of respiratory problems in the recent years and here I am. Now I feel like sometimes it gets the better of me and I'm struggling a lot to remain positive in life overall. 

I had 2-3 spontaneous pneumothorax during my early twenties (20-21 years old) that went pretty much unnoticed until I had a bigger one that sent me to the ER. The first diagnosed one was not that big and at that time I only had to rest for a couple days. A couple months later, I rushed to the ER with a more major episode; this one required a thoracic drain. Being my second confirmed pneumothorax on this side, I had VATS surgery and pleurodesis on my left lung a couple days later (2016). Things were not so bad afterwards, but unfortunately, I had another major episode of spontaneous pneumothorax about 1 year later (2017), this time on the right side. Again, thoracic drain then VATS + pleurodesis. This time I noticed that my breathing was significantly harder than after the first surgery.  I also need to point out the fact that I had 2 other, non related surgeries before. One was in 2013 to repair a nasal deviation, and the other in 2015 which was a big one (jaw advancement surgery to correct a weak chin and try to correct the mild sleep apnea I had begun to suffer from at that time). 

After the last lung surgery (2017), I thought it would get better over time, but frankly, I've lost a hell lot of stamina since then and breathing has become a hard task for me, everyday, with ups and downs. I started developing this habit of sucking in large amounts of air through my mouth and kept thinking ""wow, I can't even have a satisfactory breath anymore"". This had become so frustrating that 2 months after that surgery, I didn't cope at all with anxiety and had to ask a leave from my work / studies and had a bit of a burn out. Started taking anxiety / depression pills which numbed the negative thoughts that I attributed at that time solely to anxiety from my studies. I did complete my studies, which was no easy task; still had a few breakdowns and panic attacks from time to time, even on meds. I took those meds for almost 2 years and a half and decided to slowly taper them then stop them after I got my degree, because I was feeling better and more in control. The breathing thing was no better at all though, I was still gasping for air every couple breaths, and I even noticed that I was out of breath by talking to other people (even when I was not stressed out). But I kinda learned to live with it and the meds did their job of creating an artificial feeling of joy overall, even if inside of me, I was still feeling always tired and not up to much apart from playing video games and avoiding my responsabilities in life because of constant tiredness. 

But now, I've been off my meds since about 4 months and I went through hell trying to taper the drug. I was soon struck by the realization that I was still feeling out of breath most of the time, even at rest, almost 3 years after the last surgery, and so I had to change my approach at breathing, started doing some yoga, started finally focusing on breathing by the nose and avoid gasping air, etc. This eventually got rid of the crippling feeling of being out of breath even at rest, but I still feel like I must deploy big amounts of strength to get an OK breath (like breathing has become something really difficult and not something natural at all since the last surgery). To top all of that, I forgot to mention earlier that I also have a chest deformity called ""pectus excavatum"" (you can look it up on internet) and this causes my chest to be sunken, stiff, and it basically does not expand much when I breath, giving me the feeling that I need to work very hard to take a proper breath but never get the satisfaction of feeling my lungs fill completely. It kinda feels like a weight prevents me from breathing on my anterior chest. Before the lung surgeries, I didn't really care that much about the chest thing, but now I feel that it might be part of the problem, but it's hard to say... 

So yeah that's about it. I learned to accept a bit more that my breathing is not as satisfactory as I would want it to be but some days, I get so tired of finding breathing difficult that I just start to cry. Sometimes I don't feel like living like this is OK for a 27-year old but I guess life is life. I don't really know what to do about that and my girlfriend gets pretty tired of hearing me repeat the same things as she feels I don't have the right mental approach to the problem. So here I am, seeking advices from strangers. Sorry about the long text, just had to get it off my chest. ","Hello there

I arrived to the hospital by then my lung re- inflated. I stayed in the hospital for a week, the pulmonologist told me it just happens since you are very slim and he said MUST  OF THE TIME IT HAPPENS AGAIN, those words triggered  anxiety and i developed PTSD diagnosed by the ER. so while in the hospital i keep feeling like the Pneumothorax would appear again and i had back pain chest pain and pressure and a lot of irregular heart beat, they did XR every day or every other day and no pneumothoraxes, but in mind i keep insisting something its not normal  i got  discharged  got home my PTSD was on the roof or was it my lung having mini pneumothorazes ? that was my question all along. It took me about 4 years to get over the PTSD, although i still have anxiety and leads to depression. Its been 10 years and my left lung sometimes acts up like i am about to have a lung collapse i believe so because when i carry or push something i get pressure in my back and chest tightness shortness of breath it last hours or long minutes, yesterday i was swimming under water that triggered the same discomfort i just explained, besides that for 10  years everyday i have some time of discomfort for example:  singing (not professional but hobby) laying on my bed when i sleep sideways feels something moving in my chest inside, sometimes back pain the entire back from my shoulders to my waist, not often but i get needle  pain. i dont want to tire you reading. my reaches have lead me to think this : Do i have blebs thats why i fell the discomfort ? if yes why ? i read blebs its because of genetic diseases ( LAM, Birt Hogg Dude and so on ) or is it catamenial pneumothorax ? i am going crazy with so many possibilities i just wish i know what i have or is it really just anxiety ? So from all this i came down to something that can help me at least to know a CT scan which i never had i ask a doctor she says no need. 

also have any of you experience this : when i feel discomfort my blouse stick to my back and or chest area more the left side. like static.  i dont know if i am explaining myself clear. 

Anything that can recomend me ? i will keep puching for a CT scan... 

thank you for your input. 
 
 
 
 
 ","Hi there,

I can relate to the anxiety triggered by previous pneumothorax. I had at least 3 (and probably more before the first diagnosis). Pneumothorax is one of the medical condition that triggers a lot of anxiety afterwards because we feel totally out of control about it. It's like a vital part of our body just stops working all of a sudden and it can happen anytime. Most people don't realize that breathing plays a large part in their mental well-being until they encounter some sort of breathing problem in their life. I just wanna say that it is totally normal to feel what you feel right now. Almost everybody would feel that way after experiencing it.  

I remember when I had my first major episode of pneumothorax. I had a chest drain and since I already had a minor pneumothorax before on the same side, the surgeon decided to perform surgery on my lung to avoid relapses. 1 month later, I was eating lunch outside during a warm summer day. I told my girlfriend I had trouble breathing and started panicking. We took a cab to the nearest hospital, which was 30 mins away. At the hospital, I did an X Ray, which was fine. They told me it was probably anxiety. I'm still not sure if it wasn't a minor collapse that they didn't see on the X Ray (which is not impossible btw) BUT you should know that if we can't see it on X ray (and potentially see a really small one on a CT scan), you can be certain that it's not life-threatening, if you are otherwise healthy. 

As a health professional, I can say that blebs are fairly frequent, especially in the population that is at risk of pneumothorax. Most of the time, there is no real genetic cause (or disease). It's often a matter of growing up fast, coupled with a lung growth that is a bit too quick. Instead of having little alveoli everywhere, you can have some larger ""bubbles"" with weak lining that can break up easily, especially in the upper part of the lungs, and sometimes that leads to pneumothorax. It's not impossible that you have it since small ones can only be seen on a CT scan (that was the case for me, I had several blebs on both sides, for which I had surgery a few years ago). If I were you, I would avoid thinking too much about rare genetic diseases as they are fairly uncommon and most of the time, the simpler explanation is the right one (especially in the case of pneumothorax which is highly correlated with anatomy). Easier said than done, I know. As for catamenial pneumothorax, I never encountered this condition yet during my medical training, and I can't relate to that of course because I'm a man, but you should know that this condition happens during or around the menses (2-3 days around). If it doesn't seem to happen during the days around the menses, then it is not catamenial pneumothorax. This is a fairly rare condition. Most of the time, it is part of another condition called endometriosis, which often cause pelvic pain, abdormal vaginal bleeding, etc. Don't think too much about it if you don't relate to that. 

If you already performed X Rays on several occasions and they revealed nothing and you still feel weird symptoms from time to time, I would suggest you continue insisting on performing a CT scan eventually because blebs are common and can be a reason for surgery if you do have them and if you still experience symptoms. Just know that sometimes blebs can break up but don't always cause pneumothorax. It can cause discomfort and anxiety without being life-threatening. Nevertheless, a good rule of thumb is never hesitate to go to the ER if you experience a fair amount of shortness of breath with or without pain and TELL THE NURSE that you already had a pneumothorax before and that you are concerned about that. If occasional shortness of breath is a concern and you notice limitations in your life of symptoms happening during physical effort, you could also bring the idea of performing a respiratory function test and a test for asthma to your doctor but from what I hear, your symptoms don't seem highly correlated with physical effort. 

I hope this helps and I will stay available if you still have questions.

I got discharged from the hospital after 4 days and later had follow up X rays within 2 months and it was all normal.

Since it was a recurrence the doctors referred me to Surgeons, and the surgeon has suggested me for a lung surgery to prevent the recurrence.
And also have told me not to fly unless I get the surgery done.

I had moved out of my country for work and do need to visit my family atleast once a year.

I am still in a state of confusion whether I should undergo this lung surgery? My chest tube insertion was a very painful experience.

Is there any way to skip this surgery and be able to fly and prevent Pneumo? Or is there a possiblity that if I dont fly for few years and also there is no recurrence then how much is the possibilty of a recurrence?
I really dont want to get the surgery done.

Awaiting for replies..

I would defineatley have the operation because often a pneumothorax happens in rest times.  I have had twelve on the right hand side and 3 or four on the left with constant bubbling.  I have now had a pluerodesis and thoracotomy on both sides to resect or sew up the holes in my lungs.  I wouldn't suggest scuba but I can travel on planes overseas with the confidence that ther is only a ten percent chance of my lungs ever collapsing again after having the operation.   I am twelve years on with the operation on the right hand side and have travelled overseas,  been snoorkeling on the barrier reef ( a great comprimise to scuba - they won't let you if you have had pnuemothorax)  I am also a professional saxophone player.  I have recently had a pluerodesis on the left side ( 9 weeks ago)  and am hoping for a full recovery.  There is residual pain on both sides caused by scar tissue and I need to be carefull of sports and rapid upperbody movement.

So - have the operation - you'll be better off than not.

Sincerely

Honestly, don't worry. I had the same operation around 5-6 years ago and the 'tingly' numbness stretched from the middle of the front of my chest, all the way round to the back.

After the surgery I had the phantom pains for awhile like I was having a collapse but those have gone away and things good for years now. However the past week or so I get sharp stabbing pains feels like the lung is trying to tear itself loose from the chest wall. When the sharp pain of that is not there the area the pain was at has this dull ache like I took a few punches to he area. Doc ordered xrays but I will tell ya I can&#39;t go thru that surgery again the recovery nearly cost me my job and was a nightmare only thing helped me in recovery was toradol suppose to only take for 5 days due to its potential to damage kidney or something but was on for 10 days to be comfortable.  So trying to get a consensus on tose of u it has failed for.,To my knowledge I&#39;m the only person in the world have this operation more than once on each lung. The chance after the operation is 1% of it needing done again. You can have the puncture without the collapse. The ribs act as scaffolding to ensure it stays inflated even if punctured. Trust me if it was tarring off your chest wall you&#39;d be unconscious in minutes at best. More than likely it&#39;s one of three things first the least severe tendon damage caused by sneezing coughing stretching. Second muscle tare/damaged caused by same as tendon. Lastly the most severe your lungs punctured. This can happen the same way the collapse did also any of the above can cause it. It&#39;ll take 6-8 weeks to heal. But the most plausible is that it&#39;s your body getting used to its new layout. Your ribs now breathe for you instead of muscles. Those same muscles have to repair themselves same as the tendons between your ribs this can take three months. I&#39;m my opinion it&#39;s the later it took me about a year for my body to repair and I never go a day without pain.

If you are stuck on a bus it could be very uncomftable with bumps and vibrations so try and be as comfortable as possible with something against your back. Also if you cant get to emergancy the only thing i would suggest is some pain releif. I have had 4 Spontaneous collapses on my Left lung then went to surgery and now my Right side has collapsed twice both times just rest and pain medication management. Sometimes if it is only a small collasped (which can still be excuciating) they just suggest rest and pain medication like panadol 2 every four hours 8 a day and it will inflat hopefully in time. I do hope you are ok and best of luck it is only small. Try not to stress and breath gentally as best you can. ",neutral,neutral,

I am assuming this was a spontaneous pneumothorax
if a 2nd happens be sure they do a CT scan of the chest to look for blebs at least then you would have an idea for a cause.

Fit and healthy, non smoker, Train regularly. Due to my work I take an average of 10 flights within Europe every 6 weeks. I also swim in the sea and dive down to about 5m quite often.

I suffered from a pneumothorax 2 and half weeks ago. I had been doing sprint running and press ups in between on the beach. Then went for a swim in the sea which was 17deg. An hour later I felt sharp stabbing pains in my upper chest and back and found it hard to breath properly. I waited two days to see if I would get better which I did not, So I called a GP. She suspected pneumonia and started me on antibiotics, and told me to get my lungs X-rayed. I did not foolishy as I decided to try and get my strength up for a course the following week. A week later I flew to Cork from Barcelona (2 x flights). Felt alot of pressure and slight pain in my chest during the flights. I then completed a 3 day firefighting course and Sea Survival techniques. I was wheezing very often and found it a bit difficult to breath. After this was completed I decided to go to the doctor and he told me to get my lungs X-rayed. The hospital then admitted me as 50-60% of my right lung was collapsed. They tried an Aspiration procedure first which didnt work. Then they tried a drain for a day which also didnt work, so then connected the drain to a suction. This re inflated my lung after 2 days. I was 4 days total in hospital. 

I am now out of hospital but am experiencing the odd stabbing pain in my chest. I do not have any difficulty in breathing so do not think it is collapsed again. But am a bit paranoid now. Has any body else experienced this after the pneumothorax has healed? 

Does any body know why this may have happened or what I can do to prevent it in the future? The doctors could not tell me why this happened. I love to scuba dive and free dive in the sea. My doctor has told me that they do not reccomend to Scuba dive ever again. I cannot give this up. Has anybody scuba dived again after a pneumothorax?

They have also told me that I can resume training and running a week after I have gotten out of the hospital. I have read here in some of the discussions that heavy training is not reccommended for up to 6 months after. What are peoples experience in this? 

The main question I have is, what can I do to strengthen my lungs up and to prevent this from happening in the future. "," Hi Alex, Sounds like possibly Spontaneous Pnemothorax, which if this is the case it truely is best to listen to the doctors when they say &quot;no scuba diving&quot; this is because of the pressure and oxygen i can only presume. I have suffered 5 in the past 2 years and they can come and go like hot cakes with no reasoning at all! Listen to any pains or symptoms, although you may not feel short of breath it could still be collapsed a short % you just have a high pain threshold, not all of mine did i feel short of breath. Sometimes just some panadol when the pain accurs is enough for it to heal on its own they dont always require drains for treatment. Rest and Recover. As for strengthening after i had surgery to fix my left lung and right lung collapsing shortly afterwards i started yoga, which i 90% think has helped and stregthened my breathing lungs. Withing 2 months i was completely back to normal and whenever i feel pain yoga seems to stretch it out and i feel amazing afterwards. 10% mind over matter. Not sure this will help with scuba diving again but it might help your strength for something to work towards especially getting back into fitness again, that is one thing i do miss a lot!! but can walk, jog, lift and live normally again 8 months down the track <img src=""http://s8.patient.media/forums/emoticons/smile.gif"" alt=""smile"" /> hope you find what will work for you - Always listen to the body never ignore what its trying to tell you. if its one thing i have learnt is the body truely is a temple and we take it for granted and push it to much!

I can also see swelling under the rib which was not there prior to VATS, but none of the doctors are concerned and think the muscles just relaxed with the anasthetics. It is there all the time despite still taking codiene and paracetamol - sneezing is still agony even with the drugs. I have lowered the dose during the day due to driving and being at work (taking 2x co-codamol 8mg/500mg 3 times, then 30mg diahydrocodiene before bed). I have seen a nerve specialist who put a block into my rectus sheath (that is in your abdomen despite how it sounds!) but it has had no effect. I have refused to take pregabalin which was reccomended by my surgeon due to doing a bit of research and being warned about it first hand by a friend who is a mental health first reponder who says they use that drug as a &#39;chemical cosh&#39; and sees alot of people who have become addicted. They did also offer amytriptyline but again was warned, and feel like it is simply covering up the symptoms of something else. The pain specialist has basically said he can do no more other than offer me the same drugs, or maybe try a TENS machine.  As it is so long since the surgery, I am quite worried that something else may have been damaged by the surgery. I asked the surgeon about a torn diaphragm but he said that if that was the case he would have seen air entering the cavity post surgery so thankfully ruled that out. I have had a collection of fluid in the bottom of the lung since VATS which has neither improved or worsened (another consultant thought they had taken some lung away as it looked like the diaphragm had risen up by an inch or two on the xray) and so last week was discharged by the thoracic team. I have not had any scan since VATS other than the ultrasound used to put the nerve block in.  Has anyone else suffered anything similar? I am obviously concerned that I have been on opiats for so long, and have now decided to start weening off, as it could be that I am now quite tolerant to them - although I know about it if I miss a dose as the pain gets worse. I feel I am at the point where I just need to stop the drugs and work my way through the pain, but would like to know if anyone in a similar situation has found a way of coping, or if it turned out to be another problem. 6 months on I know there are people who do still suffer so maybe it is still early and I just need to work through it and stop being such a wuss, but not sure if there might be an underlying problem and what that could be.

I now drink lots of water daily, and have cut back on salty foods. I havent had any problems with my lungs for years now and my skin is clear and not dry.

I had a pneumothorax 7 weeks ago. The doctor explained that it is a hole in the lung. Since then i have been trying to figure a reason for this as the doctor didn't give me a concrete reason as to why this happened to me. The only thing i could come up with was the fact that i hardly drink any water (mostly Tea). It got me thinking that any material which requires moisture but is left to dry could develop tears (or holes).

Fast forward to now and I kept getting the pain every 2-3 weeks, so i decided to go to the doctor and to my surprise was a collapsed lung. Went back to normal, then It happened again 2 weeks later so I went to a specialist and surprise surprise, he recommended vats with pleurodesis. I had the surgery about a week and a half ago. Actually am doing great so far, serious numbness and tenderness around the large tube I had in, the numbness and tenderness basically is from my upper abdomen and goes kinda in a straight line under my pectoral muscle to the chest, and then some random sharp pains but am no longer on pain meds (my choice) The other small tube I had in has no pain at that location or the incision. Worst pain of my life waking up though and I was crying out for help (literally) and they really gave me some pain meds, I was messed up for hours, though Im sure its not uncommon. Also couldn&#39;t pee and almost needed a catheter.

Now its monday and I woke up with the damn dreaded bubbling, I go in for an x-ray and its partially collapsed AGAIN. All my surgeon said was to get another x-ray on wednesday and got no more info, not even the percent of collapse, though the lady on the phone said it was small.

Not sure exactly, but my chest cage, lung cage, shrank relatively suddenly - the doctor noticed the xrays looked as if they belonged to different people.

Is this how life is going to be for me or am I just being impatient about recovery?  Is there anything I should talk to my GP about as lately I have a bad cough, mucus, increasing pain levels and wheezing which wakes me and keeps me awake around 3:00 am for the last 4 nights.  I just feel I am visiting my GP for the sake of it when all I get told is recovery will be slow and I need to be patient and then just get handed yet another morphene prescription.
 ","Hey. 

Sounds like you have had a really tough time. I had a pneumothorax and lung surgery 2 years ago, it took me nearly a year to get over fully, I was in pain and tired for a long time. I think recovery is dependent on several factors, age, fitness, type of surgery, and mental attitude.  I think yours is slightly more painful and invasive then the typical  Pleurodesis surgery. 

What you have been through will take time to heal, mentally and physically, a long time and it will slowly get better and some days will be worse than others. I'm not a doctor and I can't comment on your health but if your cough is persistent then I would make sure I saw a doctor and maybe have a chest X-ray... When was the last time you had one? 

I know it's not easy, it's heart breaking and such a trauma to have to deal with but it will get better and you have to stay strong, I would walk everyday and try go just that little bit further, the body takes a long time to heal and scar tissue can be quite painful, remember what you have been through. 

It's been 2 years for me now and every now and again I get the odd pain that may last an hour or so but I was determined I wouldn't let it beat me or take over my life, some days I still worry that it may happen again but then I remain positive and sometimes still take every day at a time. 

I hope this helps, I know it won't change much but hopefully it will reassure you and help you take every day as it comes. Remember your worst days can only ever last 24 hours, no more and then it's a new day. 

Keep in touch and keep smiling when you can.

But how long does this pain last? It&#39;s been 6 weeks?  The craziest thing I&#39;m experiencing is the panic feeling,  i don&#39;t think anyone in my family realizes how painful a chest tube is.  But im seriously living in panic, i guess the fear of the unknown of this happening again.  And the thought of another chest tube again and being awake for it is driving me crazy... i panic and can&#39;t breath.  I just don&#39;t know if I&#39;m alone with this or not. ?? ","No Dawn, you are not alone.  Chest tubes, and the fact that they do not sedate you, are barbaric.  I had nightmares about my first chest tube.  It is impossible for someone who has not been through it to really understand. 

Being put put to sleep for your tummy tuck surgery may have been what caused the collapse of your lung.  I have had a good bit of surgery in the past and every time I am put to sleep, the positive air pressure in the lungs from the breathing apparatus used during surgery causes a bleb to pop.  Prior to my pleurodesis surgeries, this would cause a lung collapse.  

Hopefully, you will never have any more lung problems and this was an isolated incident due to being put to sleep for surgery.  The pain should go away, it just takes a bit of time.

I had suffered 3 small minor spontaneous Pneumothorax's on my left lung my biggest being a 5cm collapse from the top. From seeing specialists yet found that it could be getting caused by blisters bursting in the lung causing air to be released. Thus being I qualified for lung surgery where they would do key hole, get rid of any blisters then staple and glue the lung to the wall to prevent any going forward if any more were to burst. Surgery went well, I had a chest drain for 5days following and have only just recovered a month on now. 

This morning I woke up feeling great, slowly getting off my painkillers dreaming of a glass of wine and then felt sharp sudden pain on my right side which I knew would be a collapsed lung. Sure enough we went into emergency and my right lung had collapsed 5cm. 

I really want to know if anybody else has had both lungs collapse or if they had blisters or know why this happens? At the same time I do hate and hope nobody has gone through this pain and trauma because it's horrible but I would love answers!

I am a 20 yo male who suffered from 3 spontaneous pneumothoraxes last year in very quick succession. The first one occured on the 22nd of april on my right side. It was small so my physician told me to rest for a month. After exactly 35 days i had another one this time on my left side. It was big and i had to put a chest tube. It was a horrific experience but i didn't have to do surgery yet because 2 months later i had another one on my left side also and had to go under the knife. I have been very paranoid about it happening again on my right side since i didn't do a surgery for this part. I still feel constant pain on both my left and right chest part. After going to multiple doctors and getting the same answer that internal surgery will cause pain and it needs time, I decided to go to physiotherapist who explained to me that there is a membrane called fascia (google it for more info). He told me that you need rehabilitation to get this membrane back the way it was before the surgery. I am going to his clinic next week and start this treatment.

[b][Short Story][/b]
I'm 28, 6'2"" and very skiny. Used to smoke before this happened as well.
Had VATS (lobectomy+mechanical pleurodesis) done about 2 weeks ago folowing 3 recurrent pneumothoraxes on my left side.
Recovery up till this point has been extremely swift and pain has loosened up to the point I no longer require painkillers.

3 days ago I went to the hospital to get checked out for the most horrendous sound coming from below the ribs on the same side, espectially audible when hungry. The thing is this sound has not been there before the surgery and it's extremely loud (dunno if it can be called gurgling, it's something along those lines, or like things are rubbing eachother). You can literally hear it from a few feet away - disturbing stuff.
The xray was clear and they've told me I have absolutely nothing to worry about. There's also a dip on the left side below the ribs that they can't explain.

What concerns me even more is that for a few days now I'm having shoulder pain. People that had pneumothorax probably know the pain I'm talking about - the docs say it has to do with the diaphragm being irritated.
Now, I've had some of this pain prior to taking the above mentioned xray but it only seems to have gotten worse since. It mostly happens when I sit (like on a chair).
Granted, I have been sleeping on my right side in the meantime but this is really worrying me.

I don't wanna be knocking on the hospital's door daily (I've just had an Xray 3 days ago). Anybody else started having shoulder pain a few weeks after surgery that they can explain?

Thanks,
B. 
 
[b][Long Story][/b]
I've had preventive surgery done on the left side about 2 weeks ago after recurrent pneumothorax (3 of them). The first one happened about a year ago but I had no idea what it is so I never went to the doctor, it eventually healed by itself (it took a long time, but it healed). The second one happened about two months ago and that one sent me to the hospital. They guessed what it is and I took an x ray to confirm. Chest tube followed and given it was healing well I was sent home within a 3-4 days to continue recovery there.
Recovery went fine and progress to 95% for the first 2 weeks, but during the 3rd it recollapsed a little bit when I got out of bed in the morning. This time around they only did the aspiration with a syringe (800ml of air I think it was). 
After this 3rd episode I had VATS (video assisted thoracic surgery) and the doctors performed a lobectomy (removed the top of my left lung, maybe 20-30%) and mechanical pleurodisis. The surgery was considered to be a success, recovery went really well, the chest drain was removed 2 and a half days after surgery and I was sent home after another day. The doctor said I have a bit of trapped air in the appex but that's almost normal after surgery and I shouldn't be worries. Follow up after a 3-4 weeks and before going back to work to confirm the air has been reabsorbed. 

I'm home now, 2 weeks after, and the pain is loosening, everything seems to be going according to plan. Because I was hearing very loud gurgling/rubbing like noises from below the ribs on the left side I went to the doctor's this Friday to check and took an xray but there was nothing there. This gets worse when I have not eaten, but it is something that I was not experiencing before the surgery, it's very loud and scary, it sounds like things are rubbing eachother and you can hear it from a few feet away.

I also started experiencing some shoulder pain (people that had pneumothorax are probably very familiar with this pain) a few days before I got this above mentioned xray and it only got worse up till now - when I'm writing this here. This pain wasn't there after surgery and it is consistent with the shoulder pain you get after your lung collapses. But other than this I'm not exibiting any other symptoms and the xray I took a few days ago was clear. 
Has anybody else experienced pneumothorax-like shoulder pain a while after surgery? I understand this has to do with the diaphragm being irritated but I cannot find any explanation why it would happen now, 2 weeks later. 
it happens mostly when I sit (like on a chair). 

I've only had an xray 3 days ago and don't want to knock on the hospotal's door daily but I'm really getting concerned with this.

Thank you,
Bogdan

I used to smoke about 6/7 a day for 3 years before that.

I'm 20 years old now and it's been 16 months since I had the operation.

Basically I miss being able to smoke with friends at the pub or when I'm out etc. 

Would it hurt me or would there be bad results if I were to smoke 1 or 2 a MONTH. Literally only 1 or 2. (I barely go out)

I don't want to hear the ""Smoking is never good."" blah blah blah. I just need to know whether 1 or 2 a month would have catastrophic issues on my lung. 

It will be tobacco also (Roll ups) not cigarettes.

Please advise!

Dan","Hi Dano, Thanks for posting, 

I also had VATS pleurodesis on both lungs (around the same time as you acctually) and am also a smoker, I used to smoke around 15 a day before the first problems emerged. 

After the ops, I didn't touch a single cig for 6 months and felt pretty healthy at this stage but soon fell back into my old habits. I've been smoking for about 8 months again. I felt fine for 6 of those but over the last 4-6 weeks it has become quite sore again, undoubtedly as a result of smoking. (You should be aware im only smoking 6-8 a day, plus the odd joint - tsk tsk I know)

As much as I HATE the thought of giving up again it's beginning to feel like I don't have much choice as the discomfort can be severe at times.... but to answer you're question, one or two smokes won't cause any dramatic harm then and there, but can you really resist the urge once you start again to keep it at one or two on a night out? - I know I failed in this respect :)

I have also invested in one of those E-Liquid based E-cigs - This is probably still not advisable from a medical standpoint but I found that they caused less irritation that traditional cigs. - (If you decide to try e-cigs, don't buy the ones that acctually look like cigs).

Not everyone gets on with them but I would recommend trying those first if you haven't already. 

I hope that helps somewhat, let me know if you have any more questions :D

I am confused as to how you could have an actual pneumothorax after your surgery.  With my surgery, pleural abrasion was part of it, which caused the lung to adhere to the chest wall, making it impossible for it to ever collapse again.  I have had blebs to pop since, but no collapse.  Did they do pleural abrasion to you?",neutral,neutral,
775,Flying after Spontaneous Pneumothorax,/forums/discuss/flying-after-spontaneous-pneumothorax-709969,3,Pneumonia,Flying after Spontaneous Pneumothorax,"So I had my first Spontaneous Pneumothorax in October 2015 in my left lung. My 2nd pneumothorax did not occur until September 2018 and then the 3rd in March 2019 which is when I had to have my lung aspirated, all on the left lung. I had VATS Bullectomy Pleurodesis in May 2019 where I have been told that the procedure was a success. Pneumothorax has recently occurred in my right lung (which I have never had any problems with). My current Pneumothorax is only tiny...1.47cm so Doctors have said it will heal on its own. I am due to fly to Turkey in just over two weeks and I am also scheduled for a Fit to fly test at the hospital to determine whether my lung/lungs will be able to hold the air pressure. 

Has anyone had this test? If so, does anyone know what the test consists of? 

How likely is it that I will be able to take Oxygen Supplement with me on the flight?

Also, if the doctor advises that I am safe to fly, I will be really nervous too fly just incase my lung was too collapse during the flight. Has anyone experienced a pneumothorax during flight?","I flew from Barcelona to Amsterdam and then onto Dublin with a pneumothorax. My lung was 60% collapsed and I thought it was pnemonia so I took the flights! When I got to Dublin I did a 2 day firefighting and one day sea survival course and then after this went to the hospital because I was in bad pain. Thats when I found out it was 60% collapsed. 

There is mixed reports about flying with a pneumothorax. There is only a slight air pressure difference as the inside of the plane is pressurised. Some doctors say you cannot fly for 8 weeks after a pneumothorax and others say it is ok to fly. Hard to know what to believe! 

I survived, haha. I dont even think you would need the oxygen. The inside of the plane is kept at a relatively cosntant pressure. Think of a plastic bottle on a flight. There is a slight difference in pressure noticed, but this is closed. Your lung is like a bag and you are constantly breathing in and out. ",neutral,neutral,

I had VATS for spontanious pneomothorax almost 3 months ago. I would like to exerxcise in 3 months due to pain and a little intermitant breathing problem. I notice a trend online in people that continue to exercise hard after pneomothorax have another pneomothorax episode. I guess this is obvious and expected. If you train too hard it can cause another epsiode. 

My question is, how do I lose weight without working my body too hard? This is what I would like to achieve by the end of the year:

1. Light or medium walking for 30-45 min. daily.
2. Using weight machines, doing crunches, leg raises 2-3x per week.
3. Relying more on a high protien diet instead of excerise to keep in shape and a lower body fat.

I am a 21 year old female who first started getting spontanius pneumothorax's when i was 19 on both lungs. Last year (when I was 20) they operated on both lungs, on seperate occassions, to perform a bullectomy, pleurodesis and pleuroectomy. (Top marks for remembering the names!) I am now one year on from having the surgery, like others that I have read about on here, I also have the sharp pains on both sides sometimes. They are normally like a sharp stabbing pain for about 30 seconds and then it goes. (Something to do with nerve damage from the operations I have been told). However, the reason why I am writing on here is that yesterday the dreading air bubble sound in my chest came and I was feeling a bit of pain (exactly like the symptoms from my other pneumothorax's). So, I went down to a and e, had an xray which came back fine. However, I woke up this morning, the pain was slightly worse, and the air bubbling sound is still there. I dont know what to do. I feel silly going back to a and e, like im being paranoid or something? Its the air bubbling sound that really worries me though? Has anyone else had a similar experience after surgery? Surely my lung can't be collapsing again after having all 3 procedures on both sides? I would be very grateful for any advice or to hear similar experiences!","Hi,

I am not in the same situation, but I want to at least reply and share my thoughts. I'd imagine any kind of talk with somebody that's been through something similar can't hurt :)

First off, don't feel silly - NEVER feel silly. Better siilly than sorry. Go as often as you're concerned and as often as you need this weight lifted off your shoulders so you can continue and have a normal life. Don't burden yourself, please.
Furthermore when I had the same thing happening to me before I got the surgery (a few weeks after my 2nd pneumothorax whcih required a chest drain) I was right to do so as there was a tiny colapse of 5%. That's how I ended up getting the surgery. 

It is common for people to experience penumothorax-like symptoms without actually having the problem. There's little medical explanation behind it apart from the mind playing tricks on you, nerve damage, irritation or scar tissue forming/falling. 

Two weeks after the surgery I've heen to the A&E already because of the most horrendous sound coming from below the ribs on the operated side. I don't know if it can be called blubling or gurgling or whatever, but it usually happens in the morning (if I haven't eaten, perhaps?) when I'm breathing deeply and you can literally hear it from feet away. It sounds like organs or tissue is/are rubbing   eachother.  I've also started having shoulder pain when sitting (on a chair), very similar to what you experience after the collapses (are you familiar with this?). The xray was completely clear and there's nothing there. The doctors have no explanation for these new symptoms that appeared suddently 2 weeks after the surgery. 

I'd imagine this is not what you want to hear but unfortunately it is still possible to get the pneumothorax even after surgery. You'd have to be extremely unlucky but none of us are ever 100% in the clear.

Good luck,

Healthy with no allergies, no prior health issues - well except that i suffered a spontaneous pneumothorax about a week and a half ago. I had a chest tube in me, and recovered quite well. Yesterday I was hugging my girlfriend, and I slightly lifted her, having often forgot that I just had a procedure and to keep away from streneous activity. I didnt lift her high, maybe a cm or two off the floor.    Anyways, I felt this dull pain in my lower right abdomen area just under the lung and it feels like that feeling when you laugh really hard and your diaphragm hurts after. I am really worried that my lung re-opened again and that another pneumothorax is underway. With my first pneumo, I was breathing fine and had no shortness of breath, no low bp, no low o2 levels, nothing. I feel like that could be happening again, but not sure.    I went to the doctor today to get my stitches removed from the initial pneumo, and i told him about the pain, but he said since it isnt affecting my breathing not to worry about it (he never checked my breathing though).&#160;    If i never had a previous pneumothorax, i would dismiss the pain as random - that is how minimal the pain is. When i exhale beyond the normal exhaling threshold, that is when i feel the discomfort. Sometimes when I breathe in. The pain/discomfort only occurs beyond those threshold limits, not within regular breathing range, and sometimes the discomfort is completely gone!    To further add clarification, the discomfort has not affected my breathing from my own experience, but when i did have my pneumothorax, it didnt then either.    I do not know what I should do because I am in University and I have so many things coming up. I am going home in about a week and a half for reading week, and have a scheduled appoitnment with my family doctor. I was planning to track the discomfort and see if it goes away, or what have you.

I am about 70lbs over weight, however, before i get these spells, it my activity level is fine. So its not that. I also in the oast have had a few panic attacks. So severe at times i had to stop working and going to school. When i had those attacks, ot wasnt the same as the trouble breathibg i have now... however,  the breathing issue did throw me into panic once.. it was so bad i cried and shook. I also experience chest pain once in a while when this happens. Not always. I get very dizzy and light headed. Sometimes tingly. I have had about 3 of these spells. Once when I was about 23, 31, and now 32. When it happens, it lasts for like a month or two. It is very uncomfortable. Its like my chest wont allow me to take deep breaths. I can get one in once in a while but rarely.  I also have trouble sneezing and yawning due to this.  Seems to be ok when laying down. But trying to walk very far, even getting dressed is a task. It is waaaaay worse when showering. I almost hyperventilate in the bath. It is ruining my life. I do have afib.... i really dont think it is that.  If i dont think about the breathing it is ok usually. I try to occupy myself to take my mind off of it. I have been to the doctor 3 times. He has no idea. Says could be afib....asthma....stress..... and the hospital said maybe axid reflux... all my xrays and heart evals looked fine...besides mild afib..Sometimes i wonder if im just freaking myself out.... but sometimes it&#39;s as real as day.

43,Infection or something else?,/forums/discuss/infection-or-something-else--730479,4,Respiratory,Infection or something else?,"So it all started in late December/early January. My roommates and I got flu-like symptoms. Fever, cough, mucus etc. Eventually we got over it. Or so I thought.
Fast forward to the tail end of January (27-28th). Started developing slight vertigo. It would come and go throughout the day (I mostly noticed it in closed corridors or whenever I showered).


The vertigo eventually went away however after a few days. Weird.



Fast forward a week later, maybe the 8th of February. I started developing ear fullness, and crackling. It was dull but constant . 



Eventually I got slight facial tension on my cheeks as well. No paralysis but almost like a sunburn or my face being pulled back.



I spoke to my mother in law who's a nurse. She checked my ears and noticed they were swollen but no fluid. She suggested Motrin and Sudafed. Maybe it was sinus issue?
I used it for one week straight. Didnt work.



Eventually the vertigo came back. And now it came back even stronger. This was like the 14th of February.



I started freaking out. I would get lightheaded out of nowhere and feel like passing out. My head felt so swollen. Almost as if someone wrapped a belt around my head. So I go to urgent care thinking Im dying. They checked my blood sugar. It was fine. Hemoglobin. Okay. Blood pressure? A little high due to panic attack.



The urgent care doctor runs a basic neuro test on me...my finger following her finger, eyes following her finger etc. She checked my eyes and ears and her conclusion was... Migraine. Migraine...I've had migraines before. This did not feel like it.


She prescribed me Sumatriptan for headaches and Zofran for nausea. It did not help so a few days later I went to the physician (17th of February).




Physician ran the same test as urgent care doctor however he concluded I had middle/inner ear infection due to a upper respiratory virus that stuck around since January.


He prescribed me ear drops, Meclizine for vertigo and Ibropufen.


Now its been a few weeks since my appointment.


My head still feels swollen but not as much during the day as before. Also, my facial tension has slightly diminished. Not as much vertigo. My eyes arent spinning anymore however I still have ear fullness and crackling.
That being said, the odd thing is even though some symptoms are diminishing, I feel like I'm developing new symptoms.


It almost feels like I am drowsy, drunk. I get tired very easily. Like I need to put my head down during the day.



Also my heart rate would spike randomly. I could be resting at 60bpm then all of a sudden it can go to 90bpm as soon I start thinking about it.



The best way to describe the feeling is like I have low blood sugar with high blood pressure.



Secondly, I would get a throbbing sensation in hands and feet accompanied by cold sensations and pins and needles.



Lastly, I feel like I can hear my heartbeat and it feels like its pumping harder.


I'd like to note that all these symptoms come and go throughout the day. Some hrs are better than others but still constant every day.
Doctor likes to say that its my anxiety due to panic attacks. He says it put a lot of pressure on my nerves. But I'm not sure.



Its just so odd. I was perfectly fine leading up to the new year (working out 4 out of 7 days a week) then all of a sudden I'm having all these odd symptoms.


Is the doctor right in saying this is an inner ear infection mixed with anxiety?



Vestibular neuritis? Chest infection? 
Its on my mind everyday. Maybe thats why I feel so fatigued?

Any advice would be amazing. Thank you so much.*","It sounds to me (not a doctor) like a sinus infection. I take pseudoephedrine which is in Sudafed and am antibiotics. But you have to get it behind the counter in the US. You also need to put a hot compress on your face several times a day. Your intermittent dizziness could be caused by a sinus infection. If it's caused by a lose crystal in your ear then the Epley Maneuver will help. It is a system of movements of your head to do that will relieve dizziness. It's not something that has to be done every day it's just done once, maybe twice and then you should be good if it's a lose crystal. ",neutral,neutral,

This happens to me occasionally where if i stand to quickly, i come close to passing out but it is not very often.    So i got dressed and sat down at my computer and started getting a tight feeling in my chest. the best way i can describe it is that feeling you get when you need to or are about to yawn or take a full deep breath. So i tried to take a deep breath and i couldnt. my lungs stopped taking in air just before it would be a full breath. the feeling was for the most part constant all day. and i had to be very careful standing up as i would very easily get light headed and fuzzy. I was able to find some relief by conciously focusing on slowly breathing in as much as i can through my NOSE and hold it for a few seconds and then slowly exale through my mouth ALL THE WAY and hold that for a second or 2. It seemed to help but as soon as i stopped concentrating on that that &quot;need to yawn&quot; feeling would come back. a few times during the day I would start feeling a dull pain behind my left shoulder blade that would get worse and worse but after focusing on breathing it would subside.&#160; Another concerning symptom that i had randomly through the day was numbness and tingling in my hands and feet. what was weird is that my pinky and ring finder and that entire side of just that hand was 100% numb, like i probably could have taken a hammer to it and not felt it, but the other hand and my feet where just asleep like if i were to sit on them for a while.    So now its the end of the day and i had short lived relief throughout the day. It seems to have subsided A LITTLE but it is definately concering when you constantly feel out of breath and unable to satisfy that need. I took a cool/warm shower and while in the shower i was completely fine, no issues. once i got out, within 10 minutes im back to constantly gasping for air. and another thing i experience throughout the day was a strange sensation on my forehead and going all the way around my head, it felt like i was wearing a headband.

I was on this site 3 weeks ago with abdominal issues, which have almost completely resolved now.    Anywho, my problem started the beginning of June. I was laying down one night, and had a sudden feeling of a lump in my throat, which was very random and came out of nowhere. Being the worrywart I am, I started researching what caused this(being a hypochondriac, I probably shouldn&#39;t have done this), and the results of diseases caused me to hyperventalate, earning a trip to the ER. I was told it was anxiety, and was sent home.    Long story, I went to the ER 5 times this month. Once more for the lump (along with shortness of breath), but mainly due to me developing abdominal issues (stomach pain and blood in stool--this was due to fissures). I was diagnosed with post viral IBS, caused by a cold I had 2 weeks prior to the start of all this, which my GI told would resolve in a few weeks and was put on low FODMAP diet.    Now, my lump in throat never did disappear completely. Some days it was worse than others, and would definetely get worse when I was about to cry (I was very depressed about my abdominal problems these last few weeks), causing difficulty breathing, as I felt it was choking me.    Back to the present, for the last week or so, my lump feeling progressed along with other symptoms; feeling out of breath, itchy throat with tickle that won&#39;t go, hoarse couch, mouth breathing (my nose is constantly feeling stuffed), feeling of mucus in throat (not same feeling as lump), thick saliva, constant headaches, a slight pressure in nose and eyes which I barely felt til today, and the one that bothers me the most, a pressure in my ears that feels like you need to yawn, but I honestly don&#39;t need to.&#160;I&#39;m not that freaked out over this as I was with my abdominal issues, but still do get worried a bit when it&#39;s at its worse and having trouble breathing.    The lump feeling is right at the back of my throat, and when I checked, I had some bump at the back going down my throat.    I went to the doctor yesterday, and she told me it was postnasal drip. Gave me a nasal spray and Zyrtec. I just don&#39;t feel it is that, because I had postnasal drip before, but I had an awfully itchy throat with constant mucus leaking from my nose. I know shouldn&#39;t go against my doctor&#39;s word, but does anyone think it&#39;s something else? She told me my sinuses where pale and swollen. Thanks!

So Prior to Christmas I came down with what I can only presume was Bronchitis. In one day quickly found it very difficult to breath, and went to the doctors. All tests came back normal. This continued throughout christmas and into the New Year, when I proceeded to visit the doctor again. I was given antibiotics and told to go home and rest. This I did, but still it did not improve. I went back to the doctors one more time and was prescribed some more antibiotics and have seen a marked improvement.&#160;    I am no longer coughing up bucket loads of green mucus, my chest doesn&#39;t sound rattley all the time and breathing has become much easier, but I&#39;m still extremely anxious over the feelings of chest tightness and mucus that is still coming up, even if it is less so.    Some days I feel much better for a prolonged period of time and then the next day, the chest pain and coughing and mucus is back again. I&#39;m just scared and I don&#39;t know what to do, has anyone else experienced Acute Bronchitis for this long? Am I in danger of having COPD? Any advice would be useful, thank you! "," Hi benjyl, I get that a lot too from smoking cigarettes n not many I&#39;m extremely sensitive to them. It sounds like it&#39;s bacterial in nature if it&#39;s gone on 7 weeks usually viral ones clear up within 4-5 weeks. What antibiotics were you put on n dose n how long?     I&#39;m in an absolute nightmare right now with similar except I was given too low a dose of the antibiotic n the bug grew resistant now no antibiotics are working. I was given the run around by docs n brushed off coz they couldn&#39;t hear it in there. Well that&#39;s the greatest myth among docs you don&#39;t need to hear it for it to be there it&#39;s a bug for petes sake unless severe you may not hear anything.     Sometimes bugs are non productive meaning your body doesn&#39;t produce mucus it&#39;s just an over multiplying of bacteria which makes you I&#39;ll you feel the discomfort tightness pain etc in lung but stethoscope may not pick it up. Iv a bad cold now gone right down on it n I&#39;m spitting up thick gunk my lung where infection Is now worse n tighter n I&#39;m pretty sick at least they can hear it now n are finally sending me respiratory ppl it&#39;s a joke I could feel it there that should be enough.    Like when I get chest infections they&#39;re always from smoking n usually when it&#39;s bacterial what happens is it just mushroom in your lung no cold flu preceding it or anything so basically it was a bad bug already in there that multiplied coz smoke weakened tissues n made that happen so body doesn&#39;t always recognize as outside invader coz it wasn&#39;t n doesn&#39;t produce mucus if you get me n pneumonia Is known to be silent.    I&#39;v also had the productive ones with blood they all make you I&#39;ll either way. It&#39;s possible your body still clearing out but if bug is dead you shouldn&#39;t be having anymore chest discomfort it should be clear but if was really bad maybe the inflammation in your tissues needs bit time healing.

It went like this for a few days but got progressively worse.  Long story short, november 30th i was sent to the hospital because i couldnt breathe. They said they found something which is probably a chest infection so they gave me antibiotics and said to come back in a week. Came back and the symptoms were worse than ever.

Do you smoke?  Have you ever been pregnant?  Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?  Are you going through or have been through puberty?    The reactions you describe sound like immune responses. Swollen lymph nodes are a sign of the immune system at work, if it&#39;s swollen it&#39;s working hard. Vomiting and diarrhoea come into play when the body needs to release a toxin or get rid of something. Both reduce hydration, and both make you not want to eat or drink. This would easily explain the weight loss. High heart rate and shaking are usually suspects of one thing.. caffeine. Do you drink energy drinks or coffee? At the age of 14 you&#39;re not exactly on the high risk side of things. My opinion is to take a few days for yourself, rest up and drink plenty of water. Use paracetamol to reduce the body temperature and tackle any pain (if any) another thing... because you mentioned irregular period I would recommend going onto a form of contraception, help  get the hormones under control too then.     Another thing to look into is allergy tests, allergic reactions can also cause all the above... like literally all of them.    So let me know. ",neutral,neutral,

History.  About 3 months ago I started coughing really bad.  Mostly getting out in the cold and talking or laughing triggered it.  After 2 visits to the doctor, was told I had adult onset asthma.  Went on albuterol inhaler.  Within a few days, was coughing green (sorry to be gross, but you get the picture now!) and was very congested.  Went back.  Now I had asthma, ear infections, sinus infections, bronchitis.  Antibiotic, decongestant and antihistimine were prescribed.  Next the breathing symptoms got much worse.  Short of breath a lot.  Went back.  Now I received a nebulizer, a new antibiotic and steroid for the severe asthma.  Breathing got worse.  Now chest x-rays and new antibiotic and new steroid.  

Fast forward 3 months.  Coughing is better.  I'm not on an medications now.  But I have this very sharp pain in the left side of my chest, just beneath the breast.  While it doesn't hurt to breath, it is VERY painful to cough and sneeze.  Turning a certain way or lifting something feels deadly.  Also, I cannot lie down flat.

I have to constantly yawn for a deep, satisfying breath, but sometimes i cannot complete the yawn, and it causes me great chest pain and frustration. This has happened to me a few years back as well, out of the blue, and lasted for nearly 2 years until it suddenly disappeared. I spoke to my doctor about it over a video call and she said it sounded like allergies, and so she prescribed me medicine; but she told me if it didn't get better or got worse within 48 hours, she wanted me to physically come in so she could listen to my breathing. It got worse one night, so I went in. A doctor listened to my chest and told me my breathing was clear, but they wanted me to get tested for Covid as a precautionary measure, even though I am not sharing other symptoms (besides having the chills once one morning). No fever, blood pressure is great, no cough. I got tested yesterday, but no results yet. If it's not the virus, I am completely clueless as to what it is. I can barely eat because when I do, it makes my breathing x10 worse. And it is insanely difficult to fall asleep. I am terrified that what happened years ago is happening again, and that it's going to last for a long time. But this time it feels worse, I get dizzy from my yawning so much and from the chest pain it causes. It's never been diagnosed properly. I was given an inhaler years ago, but using it only made me feel as if my throat was closing even more. If anyone has any clue on what it could be, please let me know. I can't speak for long periods of time without needing to breathe. I am nervous that I will come back positive for Covid, but I also genuinely believe this is some form of anxiety, but I have never been diagnosed properly.

I've been suffering from this for 6 months and it started breaking me down mentally and emotionally. I went to two pulmonologists, allergies test, COVID test, wore a heart monitor for 3 days, did 2 EKGs, an echocardiogram, a chest x-ray, and multiple blood tests. While I ""failed"" the breathing tests (scored in line with people with asthma) the doctors were puzzled because I had no other symptoms. My allergies test came back negative aside from very low allergies to some pollens and trees, COVID was negative, and all other tests were clear. One pulmonologist said it was probably anxiety, my therapist completely disagreed, and the other pulmonologist said he wasn't sure, but both just gave me inhalers and prednisone (steroid for inflammation). Nothing was helping.
I saw on one of these threads that someone mentioned possible correlations with shortness of breath and asthma-like symptoms to acid reflux and GERD.
Since I've suffered from bad acid reflux for many years I decided to make a video appointment with a gastroenterologist. He said if heart and lungs are ruled out then yes, it can be acid/diet related. I've cut out all acidic foods and drinks, fried foods, and meat and dairy for the last week. The doctor also prescribed me GERD medication and a strong anti acid syrup that I take before meals. I haven't felt better in months!!
That is not to say this is the case with you. Just offering a possibility that I wasn't aware of before. Also, I've been trying to be mindful of my breathing and practicing the buteyko method that maybe you've seen mentioned here. If I didn't have anxiety before then I feel like the last 6 months definitely gave me anxiety after all the panicking and hunger for air.

smoker but have stopped (been off for around a month now) when i experianced chest pain around 2 months ago but i dont believe its linked

no struggle breathing at all and no pains

i get the constant urge to yawn or take a deep breath (not like the urge after exercising) 
i try to yawn and only sometimes actually yawn (rest of the time im sitting there with mouth wide open trying to yawn) or i try to take a deep breath but fail to satisfy that ""urge"", as if i breath in but hit a limit like 95%, resulting in that feeling remaing still

theres a weird feeling i get in the back of my throat similar to the urge to yawn? hard to explain the feeling, as well as a weird ""empty?"" feeling at the bottom of my ribcage at the center that happens radomly when trying to take a deep breath

sometimes i get that satisfactory feeling but the urge reemerges after 30 seconds or so
ive tested heart rate and it is normal (55-70 resting)
oxygen saturation shows at 96-98% 
been drinking plenty of water
been doing very light workouts to increase blood flow (litterally a few sets of dumbell reps) and small jogs (jog for few minuets, walk rest, jog few minuets) for around 20 30 minuets every few days

ive called 111 3 or 4 days after symptoms showed up
who told me they will have my gp call me back, 5 days go by with no call back, 
so i try to call gp directly to book a appointment, who then told me i cannot book appointments and that i have to call at 8am daily and hope theres space to book a same day appointment (crazy right?)
so i tried and still have yet to find an available day
few days after i called back 111 who then pointed me to a specialist for a phone consultation
i explained all the symptoms above (keep im mind whilst i am on the phone to them i have the urge and keep trying to take a deep satisfactory breath) and she told me it doesnt sound serious and she wont proceed any further as i sound fine on the phone.

129,Mystery Air Hunger,/forums/discuss/mystery-air-hunger-729258,8,Respiratory,Mystery Air Hunger,"I have been dealing with this issue for going on 2 years now. It has come and gone the entire time with no real reason. Sometimes it lasts a month and other times It's gone away almost completely for 2-3 months.

I am 30 years old, overweight and have high blood pressure for some background information.

When trying to breathe in it feels like I'm only getting half the oxygen I should be getting. It feels like half of it stops at the bottom of my throat leaving each breath very unsatisfying and feeling like I need to take deep breathes. I sometimes get a tightness feeling in my throat or chest when this is happening but I can find no pattern to why it happens sometimes and not others. I have found no pattern to any part of this issue or found any way to find any relief. It's all very random which makes this even more frustrating. Just recently I discovered when swimming (ocean/lake/pool) If I go in the water up to my shoulders my chest gets tight and it becomes hard to breathe. It alleviates almost instantly if I get out of the water.

Here are the things I've tried:

*Anxiety/Depression Medication (8 different kinds with no effect)
*PFT (Normal results, no sign of asthma)
*Chest X-ray (Normal Results)
*Chest and Neck CT ( Showed signs of enlarged lymph nodes)
*Biopsy of swollen Lymph Node (Came back with abnormal cells but was told it was nothing)
*Endoscopy and Barium Swallow (Stomach and Esophagus looked normal)
*ENT visit with camera down throat checking the throat and vocal cords (Everything was normal)
*Tried a generic allergy medication (Unsure of name but no effect)
*Started exercising (Most times I breathe fine through it but it gets worse after getting done and sitting down. Can sometimes be worse for an hour or more after working out)

I'm sure there is more but this is what I remember off the top of my head.

My Dr Has basically given up. After all of this he wanted to send me to a psychiatrist to circle back to anxiety. I do have anxiety but the root of this issue is not that. I do have some minor anxiety attack type things happen but that's only when I'm really struggling to breathe and the panic sets in.

Any advice, ideas, etc... would be greatly appreciated. I'm glad to answer any questions or clarify things if any more information is needed.

Blood pressure, simple neurological exam, blood work, urine sample, ekg, chest x-ray and even a ct scan. Everything came back normal.

Thank yall. "," I&#39;m not medically qualified (no-one here is as far as I know) but hypoinflation basically means that your lungs aren&#39;t inflating quite as much as they should when you breathe in deeply.&#160;    &quot;Bibasilar atelectasis is a partial or complete collapsing of the lungs or lobe of lungs when alveoli, the tiny air pockets become deflated.&quot; - i.e. when you breathe out the small balloon-like ends of the bronchi get so far and then collapse rather than staying slightly inflated. The &quot;subtle&quot; bit presumably means it is very very slight.&#160;    The difficulty you have breathing is probably due to this - it&#39;s as if you have to start blowing up a balloon from scratch every time you breathe, you know how it is easier to blow up an old balloon that is still slightly inflated?&#160;    They are things that are found in people with asthma - and if you have been given an inhaler it is probably for a very good reason!&#160;    It might be worth asking your doctor for advice about the acid reflux - because that can cause breathing problems:  &quot;Shortness of&#160;breath, also called dyspnea, occurs with&#160;GERD&#160;because stomach&#160;acidthat creeps into the esophagus can cause it to narrow. When gastric&#160;acid&#160;reaches the vocal folds, airways, and lungs, it can cause a swelling of the passages. This can lead to atypical&#160;asthma&#160;reactions.&quot;    If all these tests and opinions are from a GP, I would be asking to be referred to a specialist. The lung signs on the x-ray are probably not particularly concerning - but the combination with the acid reflux suggests that some action by someone might be called for to prevent it getting worse.

I am NOT stressed, other than from Why Dr's can't figure out what's going on & causing this to happen??.  [b]When I get these episodes I feel like my heart is racing, and I can't breathe.[/b] I find I have to fall asleep sitting up, and still awake several times gasping for air.

The last visit cost me over $4000 just to go to the ER.
I can't afford this!  To be told nothing is wrong!

Has anyone else suffered from this?
How did you stop this from happening?
What is causing this to happen?

I need to sleep!
I want to sleep, but can't because I wake up several times gasping for air, and finally will fall asleep for what seems like a few restless hours.

Please help, with any suggestions... or
Advice as to what may be causing this? and
What to do or tell Dr's to do?  


I'm open to any websites, personal experiences, potential diagnoses, and What to tell Dr's who just want to blame stress??

Also, any Cures  are much appreciated.

*I have contacted my GP about this, but they won't give me any advice. *
I'm a frontline NHS worker, I'm 23 and over summer last year I had double pneumonia, acute bronchitis and pleurisy. Since then I've had several chest infections following this. 
Also have reoccurring UTIs and pyelonephritis.
Safe to say, like everyone else. I am well and truly petrified of getting this COVID-19. 
I've had to do a risk assessment out at work to see if I'm fit for work or if I have to self isolate.  I'm awaiting for feedback, but for now they've put me on permanent nights due to less contact with patients.
I also live at home with my dad who is over 70 with coronary heart disease, and my mum who has chronic kidney disease. My partner lives with me also, he is classed as a key worker. 
Other than the basic hygiene concepts, and eating right. Do I try and contact my GP next week once they've sent out letters to the most vulnerable, for advice? Part of me believes I'm partially at risk still and want to know if there's any precautions I can take. 
Thanks 
","i personally think that you should take much more care of yourself at this current situation. you also need to take leave from work and rest at home. have food and medications on time and get good sleep. you should visit your GP with sheduled appointments and have proper check ups. please avoid exposure to people due to high risk of COVID-19.

So a few days ago, having googled again for information, I came up with it said a combination of anti histamine and decongestant is said to help, well I already take an anti histamine for an eye condition known as blepharitis, for which its really helpful but didnt appear to be helping the congestion much on its own, so I thought I&#39;ll top up with a decongestant, Sudafed, and then soon as can see my doctor see if he thinks I need to be on a repeat course of them, well I was amazed as after just the first two tablets, there seemed to be a radical improvement, hardly any phlegm or congestion and the airwaves at long last free, feeling I could breathe again and even contemplate doing some yoga, an impossibility while I was suffering so with my chest and throat condition.    I did also as back up, quite by chance, found a pot of Vic&#39;s vapour rub at the back of my dressing table and applied some of that both night and morning which also helped.

He's started to have trouble swallowing and is chewing more slowly and thinking about swallowing rather then it being a reflex action. 
He then started to have  breathing difficulties, gasping for breath. lasting for nearly 2 mins. At one point I nearly dialled 999. Went to GP who said he had a throat infection  and was having spasms and to gargle with soluble aspirin which he did but not really better. Went back to GP and had one of these attacks while there, she made an urgent referral to ENT, saying we'd hear within a few days. A week later we chased it up to find she'd marked it routine and not urgent. She did say to dial 999 if it happened again
Last weekend he one in the night - out of nowhere, again it lasted so I asked if her wanted me to call A&E. in the morning he asked me to take him there. (we did explain that it was the GP who said to go and not something we would normally do)
When not having these he's not gasping for breath and his chest is not working hard. It's almost like an acute asthma attack but in his throat. After one he keeps swallowing and can't stop - - it's most odd.
He has no chest infection, a chest xray was done - ok. He's 63, not overweight, reasonably fit. No known allergies or previous chest problems, quite healthy.
He does take omeprazole for hiatus hernia - diagnosed a couple of years ago, but has never suffered with heart burn. 
ENT appt through for 30th December
He had another attack last nght and it lasted nearly two minutes again.

I was hoping to get a new opinion on my symptoms. I am 27, female, non smoker, I have hypothyroidism, no heart or lung desease  in my family. In March and April I had really strong chest pressure and difficulty breathing, accompanied with palpitations and a knot forming whenever I would lay on any of my sides. I also experienced a feeling of suffocation right behind my nose that would not allow me to breathe though my nose, but I could through my mouth. Every morning at exertion it would take me a few hours to get use to the new position as I would get chest tightness and heavy breathing. I talked to my GP and he decided to lower my levothyroxine dosage (from 50 mg to 25) and after a couple of weeks I felt a bit better. I also got an ecochardiogram and holder monitor and both came out with good results. The thing is I still get 2 of the symptoms: the occasional suffocating feeling and the heavy/slight difficulty breathing when I change position. For example if I sit on a chair and I have my upper back against the chair I feel a constraint in breathing. It's not strong, but it's there. It also happens if I'm on my back and than switch to lying on one side: I get the light constraint in breathing that lasts until my body gets used to this position. I have to mention that I sleep ok but once I wake up I start being aware of my entire upper back and chest and my breathing. also, my nose gets stuffed the minute my head touched the pillow and it take la a few minutes for one of the nostrils to release some of the pressure to allow me to breathe

For last two years I had upper and middle back pain on & off.... back pain keeps moving under my shoulder blades or under ribs or in the middle, sometimes on one side or the other or both.... I also suffer with shortness of breathes on and off .... chest pain and pains in left knee....
I had all the blood tests which showed iron and B12 deficiency .... and a chest X-Ray which said I had prominent vascular hilar which required further assessment by CT Chest.
I am really worried and depressed that I might have some serious problem related to lungs or heart.
Is there anyone else here who has or had same sort of health issues and what was the treatment they are going through or went through? ...
Thanks.","I have similar symptoms. Last year I was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary emboli, I was on blood thinners for about 6-7 months.

277,difficulty breathing at night-:(,/forums/discuss/difficulty-breathing-at-night--196601,27,Respiratory,difficulty breathing at night-:(,"For about 3 weeks now I have been experiencing difficulty sufficiently breathing, especially at night. It's a sensation that I can only describe as a feeling of not being able to get enough air in my lungs' or 'a tightness in my chest/airways. It's still apparent during the day but worsens by night. I also have a dry cough accompanied by wheeziness when I inhale and I feel like I might need to phlegm but it hardly ever comes out. On the rare occasions that I do actually phlegm; it's mostly clear and rather sticky. 
Moreover, last week I went to see my GP, he examined my chest with a stethoscope and failed to detect any signs of infection in fact; to my surprise he even said that my lungs sounded rather 'healthy'. He did however notice that my pulse was rapid and saw that I had previously come to the doctors with issues regarding anxiety and was very keen on pinning everything down to anxiety. I was quite skeptical of this but went home and tried to ignore the symptoms. A couple of days passed and the symptoms were still there and so I booked an appointment to see a specialist nurse.I explained my symptoms to the nurse and she then examined me with a stethoscope. She said that my chest sounded fine and there was no sign of infection. She then came to a conclusion that I might be suffering from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as I told her that I occasionally get heartburn. She prescribed me some omeprazole (a medication that controls the amount of acid produced in the stomach.) 
I've been taking these every day for the past week but I'm just extremely dazzled and confused. How on earth could a stomach related issue effect my breathing? How was she so keen on pinning it down to acid reflux, even though I wasn't experiencing the main symptoms of it?? I'm just utterly confused! In my opinion I was experiencing asthma like symptoms but neither the doctor or nurse tested me for asthma. I just want some advice and closure on the subject as it's keeping me up at night and getting me worried. 
additional information:
-I'm a 17 year old male.
-I used to smoke on occasions but I've completely stopped for about a month. (could the difficulty breathing be connected to quitting smoking?)
-I've had many lifestyle changes recently, for example I've had a change in diet, stopped consuming caffeine and have been doing a lot of exercise (but however have stopped since my symptoms arose) 

Thanks you for reading, advice + your opinion would be much appreciated ","Hello JGoodman,

I replied to this and I think it ended up in cyber space so .. you may get two replies from me.

Anyhow, sorry to read you are having breathing issues.   :|

If I were you, I would be finding a doctor (and/or ask for a referral to a Respiratory Specialist)  who could give you a Bronchial Challenge Test   ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchial_challenge_test ) and then you will know for sure if you have asthma and if not, then you can rule that out.

So stay strong, be forthright, listen to your body and do your best to not get overly anxious. Stress can also do lots of weird things to our body as well, so try to relax as best you can.

Just for reference, I saw six doctors over seven months, all of whom misdiagnosed me before I asked for a referral to see a Respiratory Specialist and was diagnosed with RADS. As sad as it was to have RADS, I was very relieved to finally know what I had and I wish someone would have passed on what I am suggesting to you. Once you know .. then you can get on with dealing with it.

As for your anxiety - for me, I used to get anxiety because I couldn’t get air .. not, I have anxiety and then I can't get air. I have had some frustrations trying to explain this at times to those in the medial world.

Before I go, may I also suggest, take a look at my website, which has some very simple things that have assisted me in regard to breathing issues and anxiety. I hope it's of some use to you.

All the best and hope you get well soon.

Ps .. well done with quitting smoking and I have no idea if the ramifications of giving up have perpetuated your breathing issues? These are the questions you need to ask a Respiratory Specialist.

",/forums/discuss/pleurisy-further-attacks-and-exhaustion--20108,3,Respiratory,"Pleurisy, further attacks and exhaustion...","Hi I have just got over pleurisy. I have had several chest infections since July and then all of a sudden on the Thursday mornng when I got up to get ready for work, I noticed stabbing pains when I breathed in and cough. I thought I'd pulled a muscle and tried to ignore it during the day at work taking some ibuprofen. I went to meet some friends after work for a couple of drinks and the pain got so intense and I was struggling for breath as could only manage short shallow intakes, then of course you start panicking which doesnt help with your breathing! My friends had the bar staff call an ambulance as they were very worried, I couldn't walk except grip my chest under my left breast where the pain was. The ambulance took me to the hospital and after waiting 2 hours to see a doctor they gave me codeine 30mg, paracetamol and another larger pink tablet that I have no idea what it was. This cocktail eased off the pain somewhat. Anyway, the hospital diagnosed pleurisy and said based on my history of recent chest infections that is what it had stemmed from. 

The hospital gave me a packet of codeine and told me to take a week of work, and rest. As it was viral they couldnt give me antibiotics as they wouldnt work. However, by the end of the first week, although the pain had slightly eased off to enable me to breath a little better, the sharp stabbing pain was still there and I was so fed up of laying down and not seeing a soul for a week, that i went back to the doctors. The doctor gave me a course of antibiotics just in case there was any lingering infection that was hindering my recovery and Tramadol which, combined with ibuprofen and paracetamol was much more effective than the codeine. 

I took two works off work in total, thankfully by the Thursday of the second week, it had more or less gone just a slight pain noticeable when not taking painkillers. 

I was wondering what the likelihood is of me getting pleurisy again. I've had a fairly bad run of health this year so I'm quite worried mainly about taking more time off work. I'm a 25 year old woman and usually fit and well work 9-5 as a PA. My job is a little stressful at times but I try not to let myself get wound up as stress I know can contribute to a poor immune system. I am also absolutely exhausted still - how long do the feelings of exhaustion last? I am literally going home after work and getting my pj's on and laying down in bed. I'm not really that interested in food although just eating for the sake of it, mainly fruit and toast.

After 2 visits to A&amp;E they finally told me I had pleurisy. Sharp pain in right side that gradually has moved to both sides, back and centre of chest. Coughing is so painful! They gave me co codomal which I have almost finished. Went to dr yesterday as I was worried it might be something else. She suspects I had whooping cough and now have pleurisy, doctors in this country don&#39;t seem to believe or care about pleurisy.

I have had breathlessness (air hunger) for 4 years now. the constant urge to take a deep breathe never goes away ever.

TESTS IVE HAD DONE IVER THE YEARS:
1st general physician visit
spirometry 
chest x- ray

1st pulmonologist visit:
another chest x-ray
and a ct-scan of the chest
with another spirometry

2nd general physician visit:
ecg
cardiovascular ultrasound

asthma allergy visit:
pft
spirometry
right rib x-ray

ALL OF THESE WERE NORMAL SO FAR:

GI VISIT:
endoscopy showed acid reflux damage in esphogus 

then asthma allergy again:
spirometry showed upper airway issue (i think)
then had a metholdine something test for asthma... no asthma
had an endoscopy rule out VOCAL CHORD ISSUES

then a new pulmologist:
orders a Ct-scan of my throat.
told me to see an ent 

ent visit:
he scopes me down and looks over ct-scan
says that everything looks normal from throat up, and suggests a bronchoscopy

CURRENTLY: 
going to see the pulmonologist again to discuss a bronchoscopy


SYMPTOMS:
chest pain/tightness and discomfort.
shortness of breathe that is 24/7.
a feeling like i always need to swallow.
a very weird feeling down my throat (i think) as i breathe.
it feels like i have a smokey breathe, like im smoking on inhalation....

HISTORY LEADING TO THIS ISSUE:
i was a sedintary gamer who powerlifted as his only activity. weighing 220ibs at 5'9"" and was always laying on a recliner couch eating food aside from school.
smoked a lot of weed from 13-18/19 and towards the beginning of this breathing issue, like 17-19 i had been smoking hash oils with high tempature propane on a nail. increased the frequency and amount i smoked by a LOT up untill this started...

my doctors have told me they dont think its related to the smoking, but im nit entirely sure. is a bronchoscopy worth getting? what could this be if not a lung issue? and how would i officially rule out my lungs/throat... ?!

im in urgent need of advice and support. been a very rough journey and im struggling more day by day.

i would like to say thank you to those who reply and share their wisdom/experiences in advance.

","Hi, I'm not a doctor but as soon as I seen you and smoked in the past it could all be, [I don't know to spell the bid words] and don't take this bad. It could all be in your head. Because I smoke in my early twenties and became paranoid. It took a few years to go.

Since mainly the beginning of the year. More than likely it is anxiety you're experiencing. Anxiety can have some crazy effects on the body. Very occasionally (like tonight) I feel the same and it almost puts me on a panic attack but I know it's just anxiety. For you, if your blood oxygen level is high, the oxygen is reaching your cells. You are breathing fine. I'm not an expert as I'm trying to get control on my health anxiety too but try to get help through therapy or change life habits to become healthier. Exercise, eat right and do other physical things. (I don't do any of these but I'm working on making better changes). Anxiety can control your life when nothing is wrong but that, then you convince yourself something is wrong throwing you into a panic attack. Find ways to ground yourself during an attack and tell yourself things are fine. I've been going through this (but different symptoms) since around March. It's awful. But it won't change until you actively try to change things. Therapy and positive changes will make a world of difference, for us both.

He had difficulty breathing when I was there, always sounded full of cold and congested. His breathing was very heavy. He is nearly 1 year old.

He is struggling to breathe and has a very high temperature. The doctors&#160;there say his adenoids could be back, or he could have asthma as he&#160;is wheezy. They diagnosed him with pneumonia recently and told her to give him lots of fruit and paracetamol to keep the temperature down. And told her to come back every week to check his blood. This is because the doctors have told her he has an infection too.. low blood&#160;(9g/DL) not sure what that means but that&#39;s the information she has given to me.

I'm a 57 year old male, good health, exercises regularly and do have an anxiety disorder but no ever diagnosed asthma or other COPD issue.

About a year and a half ago, had difficulty where it felt like I couldn't complete a deep breath and found myself gulping for air but if could take my mind off it it, would be better a period of time after.  Was thought to be ""stress"" breathing by doctor.  I sometimes would get this sitting down but then again would not getting when running furiously on the treadmill.  

Fast forward to March this yea where I started to have ""allergy"" symptoms (in case this is related to breathing issue).  Mostly nasal in nature, post nasal drip, irritated throat and chest congestion, generally mild in nature but sometimes worse enough so would feel like coughing.  Still hasn't gone away and no allergy medicine has made a dent in it.

Beginning in April, started to have the breathing issue but much more intense.  Had acute episodes where it felt like I constantly have to gulp for air so that I was ready to head to the emergency room but again, would relent at least to some degree after a period of time.  During these periods of gulping air, oxygen meter was pegged at 99 percent.  At this time I had a Covid test which was negative.  Inhaler and a round of prednisone did not help (prednisone had major negative effect on my anxiety disorder).  Gradually over a month, the acute episodes subsided and although it seemed like when thinking about it, could never take as deep as a breath as before, problem largely became a background issue.

Until a  week or so when the problem has become more acute again although not as bad as April.  Not sure if related but started about the same time I came off a 10-14 day stretch where my stomach and intestines were very gassy and I started on the Prilosec.  The breathing issue became more prominent  about the time the stomach became better although it's possible the stomach issues masked the breathing issues.  I was in quite a bit of distress.  At the advice of my allergist, I have started taking steroid inhaler for four days now but that has had no effect.  There is a bit of chest congestion so that may be aiding as well but it seems like at all times, my breathing is compromised.  It hasn't been enough to stop me from exercising.  Exercising doesn't make the problem worse or better, meaning, I'm not getting out of breath any quicker than before.  I assume the breathing problem is similar enough to what I have been having for over three months which has never went away, that it can't be Covid but Saturday, I did the quick results test (Antigen, can have more false negatives than traditional molecular ones (with results are now taking 10 days)).

I have a phone conversation coming up with my PCP this week.  Any thoughts on what this could be and in which direction I should nudge him?  Any ""breathing"" issue makes me nervous to go back to work.  I wonder how much is anxiety related but the symptoms are certainly real.

341,Trouble Breathing for 3 days,/forums/discuss/trouble-breathing-for-3-days-611855,2,Respiratory,Trouble Breathing for 3 days," So about 4 days ago I went to help my cousin pick up bricks for his backyard. They were pretty heavy and at the end of helping I found that I couldn&#39;t breathe right. It felt like i wasn&#39;t able to take a full breath, so then I started having an panic attack (I have anxiety problems). I ended up just sitting it off and i felt better so i got back to helping with the bricks. The next day at night im sitting down and all of a sudden...the same feeling: trouble breathing and I felt like I could&#39;nt get a full breath, so then I went in to a SEVERE 35 MINUTE LONG ANXIETY ATTACK convincing myself it was a heart attack, so i ended up going to the ER and they checked my heart, blood pressure, took blood, took a urine sample, and took a chest X-ray. They said that my heart was fine but my blood pressure was pretty high so they gave me an anxiety pill and sent me home. During my time there sitting and waiting i was feeling better hardly any trouble breathing, but IMMEDIATLEY AS I GOT UP TO WALK OUT I FELT THE SAME PROBLEM I just wasnt panicing about it as much. So it been 3 days with this problem 24/7 and im actually pretty scared as it is has been causing me to fight the urge to fall into a full on anxiety attack all day everyday. Every night I fall into a HORRIBLE ANXIETY ATTACK now from which my family must calm me down. Im worried because i feel like the ER workers did not really check my chest xray or blood as they gave me no test paperwork and when i asked if the tests and xrays came out fine the nurse who was sending me home was not listening and just said, &quot;oh yeah&quot; then handed me the pill and walked away without looking at me at all. When i lay down certain ways its less noticable but still there i have ALOT OF trouble sleeping now. Im worried it&#39;s pnemounia or something bad. Could it be possible i just pulled a muscle by my lung (SINCE I FEEL THE TIGHTNESS ORIGINATING FROM THE TOP OF MY ABDOMEN RATHER THAN ME CHEST) And when i drink water or anything it&#39;s even harder to breathe for a while. I feel like its not in my head as i Acid Reflux from time to time and even when im not scared its there.

For the last few months When trying to breathe in it feels like I'm only getting half the oxygen I should be getting. I cant quite describe the sensation I feel when I breathe just that its not normal and doesnt feel right and I'm not inhaling as well as I used to. Almost like there's a block of some sort. I feel like theres a problrm between the airways from my nose to ny lungs. This feeling lasts all day every day till i go to sleep and I am now confined to my room as I'm too terrified to do anything or go anywhere in case I stop breathing and die. 
Here are the things I've tried:
*Anxiety/Depression Medication (2 different kinds with no effect)
*Lung function/Spirometry test (Normal results)
*ENT visit with camera up nose and down throat checking the throat and vocal cords (Everything was normal)
*Blood test (all normal)
*Tried a generic allergy medication (no effect)
*Oxygen levels are always 96-100
*ECG (normal results)
I'm sure there is more but this is what I remember off the top of my head.
I do have anxiety but the root of this issue is not that. I do have some anxiety attack type things happen but that's only when I'm really struggling to breathe and the panic sets in. My doctor insists its anxiety but I'm not convinced as it feels too real. I have had breathing trouble before but its never felt anything like this.
I am very careful not to exert myself and walk extra slowly as not to get out of breath because  i feel if I get out of breath then my breathing won't resume to 'normal' and whatever this problem is will worsen and I'll end up in hospital.

365,Post cold/flu wooziness,/forums/discuss/post-cold-flu-wooziness-629313,3,Respiratory,Post cold/flu wooziness," About a week ago, I had the cold/flu and didn&#39;t get better until recently. However, after my cold symptoms started to go away, I&#39;ve been experiencing a slight pressure on my head (both left and right), pain on my neck and shoulders, sore temples, a woozy/spaced-out/derealization sensation in my head, and a slight ringing in my ears (pretty much only noticeable when I&#39;m in my bed at night when everything is silent).    The only thing that has gotten significantly better is the head pressure (although I get random, acute head pains/irritations throughout my head). Being someone who Is easily anxious, I&#39;ve felt nauseous from time to time, but no vomiting. What&#39;s annoying me the most is the wooziness feeling in my head. I&#39;ve been able to relieve this temporarily by taking hot showers. I let the water run on the back of my head/neck, which really feels good as I can feel all the nerves being &quot;released&quot;.     Everything is good until the next day. I wake up in the morning and everything feels fine. However, I&#39;d say starting or after breakfast, the wooziness kinda comes back. I&#39;ve browsed through the internet and people with similar symptoms have said anxiety or sinus infections, both of which I&#39;ve never really experienced before. Can anxiety really do such a thing to me? I&#39;d say that I probably spend the entire day worrying about it, especially everytime I sense something in my head or neck. In terms of sinus infections, I still have a runny or stuffy nose, so I&#39;m not sure if that has to deal with this either. Honestly, the moment I wake up every morning, I lie in bed and hope that it&#39;ll be gone, as silly as it seems.    P.S. Something I&#39;m also suspecting is my pillow; the night before this all started happening, I switched my pillow with a really old one because it had the memory foam head contour thing. This was when I still had head pressure. The wooziness started happening,&#160; ","Hi Jimmy,
I hope you are feeling better since your post. I have had a cold that turned to a chest infection for which I am on antibiotics. I am getting all of the symptoms you describe including the tinnitus and wooziness which is the worse for me. I also get neck and shoulder pain but I have osteoarthritis in my neck, early stages. Because of my chest infection I too have changed my sleeping position to sitting up in bed which makes my neck ache.  When you mentioned about changing your pillow and noticing the changes it set alarm bells ringing for me. Do you have neck arthritis? Sometimes that can make you feel woozy. You are right in saying anxiety and sinus problems can also cause it. Neck arthritis can also be associated with tinnitus. I hope you are feeling better.",neutral,positive,

As well have chest pain on left side and bad coughing that bring up mucus. I initially had the breathing test done at the doctors and it was suggested I may have copd. ( I'm a smoker ) I was put on 2 inhalers, both of which didn't really do anything. 
I went to see a respiratory consultant and under went more tests, x-rays were fine, chest CT was fine and more breathing tests , consultant says there is a restriction but not significant enough to be COPD. So he ordered further blood tests and heart scans ( still waiting on heart scan) I've been back and forward to the doctor's over the last 3 months as my symptoms have worsened significantly, my breathlessness is occuring daily 2-3x a day and laying down is a big no no as I'm constantly having to sit up to try and breath properly , going outside is starting to cause me anxiety because even walking the 5-10 min to the shop is leaving me hard to breath. I was a home care assistant and have had to stop working as it was just too much. My moods have been all over the place, aggression and depression combined. I'm not sleeping so I am perminently exsauated and the slightest thing is tiring me out. 

It's worth noting I do suffer from sciatica which causes sever nerve pains in my leg, I am overweight and have been for most of my life, even though I don't actually eat alot ,  but having 7 kids and a job I have always been very active. I have suffered panic attacks during my life so generally used to the symptoms and signs off it. 

The doctors have taken a ton of bloods off me including checking my hormone levels, only thing that has came back is possible inflammation. 

I'm due an appointment at the breast clinic as I have noticed changes in my breasts, my right appears to be shrinking a bit as well as aching and (what looks to me anyway) changes in how the dark bit around my nipple looks IE it looks smaller to me, I found lumps in my armpits but doctor says it's just swollen glands and my breast is normal but referred me anyway. 
I am having neck pain on one side and shoulder pain , this ontop of my breathing issues is making it impossible to sleep. 
Other symptoms:
Fatigue
Confusion
Irritability
Depression episodes 
Bloating 

Doctor has put me on ant acids thinking it could be gerd, I've been on them 4 weeks and no changes to symptoms at all. 

The doctor has basically said to me to try yoga and lose weight. And suggesting it's all just anxiety, I've drastically reduced my smoking and cut down on caffine

I also have smaller problems with stomach. My docs said that it might be because of stress and I do take PPIs. Keep in mind that this is pretty mild and I dont think it should give me the problems.

435,Persistent cough went away has now come back,/forums/discuss/persistent-cough-went-away-has-now-come-back-708105,2,Respiratory,Persistent cough went away has now come back,"Hi Everyone

I'am a 27 year old male never smoked but since last April have been bothered by persistent cough.

It started at the end of April 2018 and lasted until late November. My GP gave me loads of different antibiotics , nasal spray , anti reflux medication all to no avail. They tried everything then eventually sent me for a chest x-ray which came back clear. Was tested for asthma as well which I don't have. It finally went away in November after I got the winter flu jab. Unsure if this would have anything to do with the jab or if it was just a coincidence. 

The strange thing with the cough is that it came on completely out of the blue , I did not have a cold or flu or anything then was unable to shift the cough , it just started then would not go away.

Another thing is that it seems to be a daytime only cough , cough all day then it starts to go away into the early evening then by night time it does not bother me at all , never kept awake by it. It is also better when lying down then starts again when I get up.

It came back a few weeks ago and is following the same pattern as before . I think I will leave it a few weeks yet before going back to GP to see if it goes away although that will probably be unlikely.

Has anyone here had a similar thing ?","Maybe an allergen causing it.   For me (I have severe lung disease) it is dust and pollen, even on steroids which lessen it considerably I have an all day cough.

I’m sorry to read about what you are going through. Please relax. Take it from someone who is constantly paranoid about everything. The common cold virus is not what it used to be. We are dealing with a mutated strain that just lingers for months. My advice is not to read too much into this as you do not seem to have any of the usual troubling signs. Do not self medicate and this tends to make things worse. If you wake up feeling like you cannot breathe, please go to the ER. Apart from that, your anxiety could be making things a lot worse, so relax. I would love to know when you’re feeling better. Warm wishes for this holiday season.",neutral,neutral,

Can't breathe and no mental or physical energy.,"So about two months ago, after just moving to southern Washington, I noticed after a night of having a few drinks that my heart rate was up. Breathing is usually hard for me after drinking too much but this time was particularly hard and my bpm was through the roof over 100. I had to quit working because I couldn't talk to customers and breathe at the same time. I went to the ER that weekend and they said I had a respiratory infection and that I needed to wait until my body fought it off. There was also a covid test which came back negative. Two months later I still can't breathe. When I seen a doctor he did a blood test but did not find any issues, he just recommended I use albuterol and take zyrtec, the first of which makes breathing a hellish nightmare. I've also tried allergy meds to no avail. I've always had a problem where any time I breathe something in, it makes it hard to breathe for a few days and then I'm ok. This time I'm not ok because I moved back home where I don't have issues breathing but I still can't take in a full breath. I have been recording the amount of time it takes to breathe in and it has increased about .50 seconds but I still feel like going to the ER at times. If you have any ideas, it would be greatly appreciated. I'm trying to get an appointment as soon as possible but I fear it will go down the same path, to a lung function test instead of trying to figure out what's causing these symptoms.

from that first admission up until December of 2020 he had 6 admissions to hospital 3 of which were to Great Ormund Street Hospital. his final admission of that year they did more intense investigations and found out he was aspirating meaning he was inhaling some of the food and drink and that he had a Laryngeal Cleft type 1 where they did endoscopic surgery to fix it. 
Throughout the spring and summer of 2021 his health has been pretty good. back in June he had a follow up appointment at Great Ormund Street Hospital where they looked at the laryngeal cleft he had and found out he was still aspirating and booked us an appoint in sept/oct 2021 for a procedure to look at the laryngeal cleft in more detail by the surgeon who did the operation. 
unfortunately at the end of september 2021 he had fallen ill again which ended up in our local hospital, meaning we missed our appointment at Great Ormund Street Hospital. This time he was in for around 4 days where he was treated with nebulizers,  oxiflow and antibiotics. since then until now we have missed our 2nd rescheduled appointment due to the same reasons and he has  been in hospital 4 times, each lasting around 4 or 5 days. on all his discharge papers it mentions he has had one of the cold viruses. 
they are refusing to do the procedure at Great ormund Street until he is well for a few weeks.
I feel as though that with the way things are going this time round and the way things went last year that this isn't going to happen as he is in hospital nearly every other week, and he wont get better without this procedure from Great Ormund Street Hospital.

So recently (about 3 to 4 weeks ago),  me and my family have been to the beach and after returning, we were tested negative for Covid. But I had been going through some shortness of breath, at first I had just been taking my abuterol inhaler. But a day later, I had started growing in fatigue and could barely move without growing terribly tired. I ended up sleeping three times a day. Then came the chest pains, on the upper right side if my chest. I took ibuprofen for the pain and it was that way for a while until one night there was a terrible stabbing pain on the left side of my chest. I got scared and told my mom and she said she'd take me to the doctor. 
My vitals were pretty normal (Oxygen levels, blood pressure) except for my heart rate. It was at least up to 160 mostly due to me being nervous.  So they sent me to the ER. The hospital took a Urine test, Chest X-ray, and EKG and they came out fine but due to the long wait and me growing tired and more hungry as the hours passed, I had to go home and check the website for my results. They saw nothing wrong. We monitored my oxygen levels and blood pressure as well as heart beat. Still my heart beat went from 94 when resting, to 130 when I moved around.  I also felt like gas was trapped in my intestines and I kept burping but that got better. As days passed,  it felt like I had a tonsil stone stuck in my lower tonsil but I assumed it was a oatmeal fiber but then my left Lymph node felt swollen but my mom being a nurse felt it and said it wasn't but it went down days later and I started to feel better and move around more without getting sleepy. Now I am dealing with Gerd, shortness of breath, chest pain, headaches and that little oatmeal fiber feeling is still in my right side. I pushed out 2 tonsil stones though, 1 on each side. There is also a little tickle in my throat that makes me feel like I'm going to cough. I looked up my symptoms (horrible idea) and now I'm absolutely terrified. Anyone else going through this?

I have free flu jabs, so OK there, but because I use Methotrexate, my immune system is lowered.

I am feeling a bit cross as, yesterday afternoon, I met up with a friend who had a very bad cough, I found out too late.  I noticed that she didn't cover her mouth either with her hand or arm, so I tried to keep out of her direct 'aim'.  Unfortunately, she was on the phone at one point and I had to lean across her to find some paper for her to write on.  She coughed full in my face within a few inches, without covering  her mouth.

This morning, I woke up feeling pretty rough.  I can tell that one of my normal winter coughs is coming but not sure if it's just from general mingling with crowds (though I haven't actually been out much) or if it was my friend who has started me off on one of my 2 or 3 month coughs.  I don't like feeling bad about my friend, but she doesn't realise just how ill I generally get.  If I become ill, I have to stop taking my Methotrexate as my immune system will  'go down' even further, and this will have the knock-on effect of, if I'm off it for too long, my rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis (or both) possibly starting up again.  She was feeling down and depressed and I didn't want to mention it, but I do have to take care of my own health.  I am 67.

Can you get symptoms overnight after someone coughs direct in your face, in which case I can only put it down to her, or does it take a lot longer, in which case I won't feel cross about her jeopardising my health and I can put it down to  general 'mingling'?","It usually take 2-3 days to get symptoms from someone else. But you need to let your friends know about your health. People can be quite inconsiderate and ignorant when it comes to their germs. If you develop symptoms, go to your doctor and ask if you need antibiotics. 
Avoid cheek kissing and hugging, which I know can be hard with certain people, but even if someone doesn't have a cough or cold they can be carrying the virus. It can appear quite rude to some people, but you have to be so careful with a weak immune system and when you explain your situation to people, they won't mind. ",negative,negative,

I&#39;ve had it before and put it down to having high blood pressure (which I do). At that time, I hadn&#39;t taken my meds for 2 days. So I took one and my breathing improved. The next day, it was fine again.    This time though, it seems different. I did the same thing on Sunday, but by Monday my breathing was worse. Went to A&amp;E, which wasn&#39;t hard as I work in the same hospital. They triaged me and because I wasn&#39;t in any pain or discomfort just rang my GP and made me an appointment. Saw the practice nurse, who checked my chest, BP, breathing, lung capacity and prescribed 5 days of steroids and an inhaler. Said to return in 2 weeks and return sooner if it gets worse.    Now, it hasn&#39;t become worse since starting the meds. But it has only slightly improved. I&#39;ve had hardly any sleep since Sunday, as I&#39;m jumping myself awake with my breath catching and any sort of exertion (i.e. I stupidly went for a run earlier) leaves me feeling like I&#39;m being hugged by a bloody gorilla.    The inhaler helps a little, but it also gives me the shakes and makes my heart thud in my chest. Likewise, the steroids have a similar effect.    I have no allergies, that I know of. And the only thing I did differently this weekend to most is that I had 4-5 beers (normal bottles) on Saturday night. Didn&#39;t go overboard and have never had a problem with alcohol. I should also point out here that I had an ablation for a-fib little over 12 months ago and (touch wood) most things in that dept. have been mostly OK since. So, I basically don&#39;t overdo it with alcohol, as that can be a trigger for some people but I do like to indulge from time to time.    I had assumed it was just a random occurrence and the meds/inhaler would resolve the situation and it&#39;d be mostly forgotten about in a few weeks but this just feels very.. odd.

Both times they have given me antibiotics, the first course didn’t work and the second course I’m only two days into but still no difference. The doctor said it sounds like a chest infection but surely it would get better in 5 weeks and two courses of antibiotics?? I’m 18 years old and have smoked before but on and off for a few months but I’m having a little cancer scare. Can anyone give me any advice or their own stories on a chest infection?? Thank you! ",i would ask my doctor to do a cxr of your lungs. And go from there,negative,neutral,

579,Temporarily stopping Rivaroxaban?,/forums/discuss/temporarily-stopping-rivaroxaban--716019,2,Respiratory,Temporarily stopping Rivaroxaban?,"Hi and sorry for not doing the normal introductions as I need guidance relatively quickly.   This concerns a relative who's currently 84 years old and has Pakinson's although this is very, very well controlled.   She does not suffer dementia of any form.

My relative was given 15 mg daily (twice daily?) dosage of Rivaroxaban back in 2013 to deal with two pulmonary embolism at the time, which may have formed during a second knee replacement before moving to her lungs.   This was reduced to 10 mg daily on discharge from hospital to prevent further clots and at the time the treatment was successful.

She was almost diagnosed with COPD at that time until a senior consultant observed that given it was 12 years since her (now late) husband gave up smoking, more severe symptoms would have shown up.   The specialist did comment on slightly lower than normal oxygen saturation, which could be attributed to the non-functioning of the lower lobe in the right lung (this may go back many, many, many years).

Fast forward to May of this year and she fell, lascerating her forehead, losing about half a litre of blood.   After stitches, she was kept in hospital and her Rivaroxiban was stopped for 7 to 10 days.   During this time, she was given a blood transfusion the day following the accident followed by ""Ferinject"" a few days later for anaemia.

Her Rivaroxaban was restarted once the wound had healed.

Since this time, she had to be readmitted twice for mobility issues (she lost confidence due to the fall) and later, twice for respiratory problems.   It's the latter I'm querying.

The current specialist seems to be heading for a COPD-type diagnosis, telling her she now needs access to oxygen at home.

I'll note except for a couple of periods of illness she has not had major issues with breathing up to the fall.   Issues seem to have developed afterwards.

My question here is twofold.   Firstly, could that period of 7 to 10 days without the Rivaroxaban to encourage the wound to heal, then the blood transfusion then the Ferinject iron supplement caused more clotting?

Secondly, would the restoration of the 10 mg dose be enough to remove any clots or would a higher dose be required.

A further observation since the fall is she's been usually skipping breakfast when she normally takes the Rivaroxaban, to which a pharmacist has commented will not help with the body's uptake of the Rivaroxaban.

I note on her discharge letter for the fall dating back to June that the withdrawal of the Rivaroxaban and the blood transfusion have not been included (an accidental ommission), thus the consultant might not be aware of these potential factors.

Any guidance would be appreciated.

Ian
",The idea of the Rivaroxaban is the keep her from getting another clot. They stopped it because her blood was too thin and that's why she bled so much with the head wound. There is a condition that some people have where their blood clouds to much. I can't remeber the name of it but I'm sure you could Google it. I would request that she be tested because it does run in families.,neutral,neutral,

I got up the steps and it felt like the air was being squeezed out of my lungs. I was gasping to fill my lungs for what seemed like ages, but in reality was probably 10 or 20 seconds.

Many people suffer from this ailment which causes people to contantly (usually in 4-7 minute intervals) to take a deep breath in order to just &quot;trigger&quot; that satisfying feeling in their upper lungs. But it&#39;s not that simple, because sometimes that feeling doesn&#39;t come. And we keep forcing that deep breath, trying to get the satisfaction - a forced yawn, contortion of the body, whatever it will take. It always comes eventually, but the cycle starts over. We all say it&#39;s worse when we eat. We all say it&#39;s not a problem while sleeping. We all say it goes away at times when we are heavily focused on something.&#160;    Trust me, I HAD it for almost 2 years, and it wasn&#39;t just once in a while. I literally had this thing NON STOP EVERY DAY until a few weeks ago.    One caveat before I say what I did - I&#39;ve talked to many people with this condition, and it&#39;s true it&#39;s not a one size fits all solution - some have hiatial hernias, others have GERD, and I&#39;m sure others have other conditions that cause it. But if you have any inkling of a thought that it could be anxiety, keep reading.    The reason why you will never hear someone say &quot;here&#39;s the cure for it&quot; is because it&#39;s not that simple. But I&#39;ll just throw it out there right now. YES IT&#39;S A COMBINATION OF ANXIETY AND LIFESTYLE. STOP seeing doctors (again, caveat - unless you think it might not be anxiety per the above), STOP reading on the internet about what people do to fix it (pepto bismal, breathing exercises, just STOP). It&#39;s ANXIETY AND LIFESTYLE. And I didn&#39;t believe it either because, sure I was anxious about a few things every now and then (who isn&#39;t?), but this thing lurks around all day even though you don&#39;t think you are particularly anxious. But I guarantee there are things you are anxious about. For me, and I bet for many of you, I was anxious about my overall health. Why wouldn&#39;t I be? I was grasping for a satisfying breath every few minutes thinking this must be the end, so it makes sense. But I did something drastic, and I admit that I am a little bit in shock that it ACTUALLY worked!    I completely turned my lifestyle upside down. I am not suggesting all of you are fast food junkies, but I was. I wasn&#39;t obese (196 weight 5&#39;10 male) but I could stand to lose 20-25 pounds. I was drinking coffee, diet coke, some water here and there - but burgers, fried foods, some good foods here and there - ZERO exercise. My waist was 38 and I remember it being a 36 for years, so this was a relatively sudden expansion.&#160;    For the past three weeks (which isn&#39;t long), I&#39;ve 100% cut out:  1) Caffeine and carbonated drinks  2) Soda  3) Fast food  4) Fried foods    And added:  1) Vegetables and fruits to diet  2) Exercised vigorously on an eliptycal for 20 min a day    As time went on and my weight dropped (now at 190.3), the need to deep breath almost exponentially vanished. I still breath deep every now and then mind you, but you have to remember, everyone breathes deep every now and then. I talked to a doctor who said people breath deep once every 20 minutes. But we are hyper focused on it, so we will think &quot;Oh geez, it&#39;s back&quot;. It&#39;s not.    I never in a million years thought I would beat this thing, especially as quickly as I did, and a couple people I know did a massive lifestyle change and they said things look better. I wish this worked for everyone, and I&#39;m sure there will be someone who says &quot;but I am super fit and already eat well&quot;. You might have a different issue, OR, it is still anxiety but as I said - I was nervous about my health - now that my blood pressure has visibly dropped and I&#39;m sure my cholesterol levels have too - I am NOT SO NERVOUS ABOUT IT and that&#39;s why my deep breathing went away. So you need to find out what you worried about and address it.    I hope this helps folks, and it can&#39;t hurt to try this if you think you might be worried about your health. I also feel there&#39;s a component of your stomach expanding (from food, extra fat around waist, etc.) that changes your breathing patterns - I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s more that or anxiety, but I don&#39;t really care as this works. Please do try it for a couple of weeks and let me know how it goes!    Again as a final disclaimer: I am not a doctor so if your deep breathing is totally unrelated to anxiety or diet/lifestyle, then you should definitely get it checked out. I can speak for myself, and many others, we&#39;ve had our fair share of doctors and there&#39;s nothing they can give you to fix it. You need to fix it yourself and I am living proof that I was able to beat it! Good luck! ","I forgot to mention things I added:

Hi,
My 4.5 year old little girl ( previously very healthy, who never even had a chest infection) contracted bacterial tracheitus(hib, strep and staph) in conjunction with influenza A, par influenza and Adenovirus. She developed hiB pneumonia and by her 4th day on ventilator had developed ARDs. Doctors thought she wouldn’t make it and were considering Eccmo, but dialysis worked in removing fluid. She was extremely ill intubated and mechanically ventilated for 30 days. The first attempt to extubate did not work as she has a partial pneumothorax ( we were told it was really tiny) but not wanting to take a risk they reintubated her and put in chest drain. A few days later they successfully extubated her and she did very well breathing on her own. After withdrawals of a number of drugs she was sent down to ward and for two weeks was doing very well. All our focus was on rehabilitation and she is now walking( though still lots of physio to be done),talking and her mind is completely recovered. All doctors were happy with her progress until they did chest X-ray which showed bi-lateral deterioration. The visible line of the heart is not as ‘crisp’ and inflammation can be seen. The day after this X-ray she fell ill. She firstly complained of sore throat, then soon afterwards spiked a temperature. Her 02 levels remained fine but her heartbeat was elevated reaching up to 160 beats a minute at one stage, although mostly stayed in 130s. For a short while her breathing was much faster ( approx 45 breaths per minute). She had a mild dry cough since her infection but it worsened and developed into a productive wet cough. She was put on  taxocin iv. After two days her temperature returned to normal and her heartbeat decreased although it still is higher than normal ( varying between 110 to 130s when awake and 95- approx 105 when asleep). A week later her humour is fantastic. The colour has returned to her cheeks. She is eating and drinking normally and all examining doctors have said her both lungs sound good ( no wheezing or crackling with air moving well). However yesterday (7 days after her last X-ray) they repeated the X-ray and found no improvement ( no deterioration either). The bloods they took on the first day of temperature show that CRP is not elevated. They have checked for 30 most common viruses and none are present. They have now put her on oral azithromycin 3 days a week and continued with iv tazocin. A speech and language therapist has examined her and thinks aspiration is unlikely but they are still going to do a video fluoroscopy to check for silent aspiration. They are going to do a CT scan at the end of next week. Have you any suggestions as to what you think is wrong with her?

I'm a 24 year old female,  healthy (or am I), don't drink or smoke, don't take any medications and don't have any previous disease record (except for pneumonia when I was 6) or surgery history.

Since I don't know what relates to what, I'll start from the very beginning:

Since the beginning of this year I have been getting a LOT of yellow mucus on my throat, which I managed to spit out when coughing. I went to an otolaryngologist, they made a CT of my sinuses (which were clear) and gave me anti-allergens for the mucus - which didn't help, but it wasn't bothering me that much so I let it go. 

In September after coming back from a trip, I felt super sick, threw up and had diarrhea for over a week - which I did go to the doctor for and they said it could be a viral infection or food poisoning. I did a feces test and it came back clear, so they gave me no medication. Symptoms subsided after 2 weeks. 

Since then I have been getting sick on and off (1 week I'm fine, the next I feel ran down, dizzy, stuffed nose, throat hurting. etc). I got 2 episodes of mild fever (37.5 degrees), but other than that I didn't get any. I got a super weird pain under my right shoulder blade  which I thought was a pinched nerve (and this particular pain did go away after a few days), but my chest/upper back started giving me sharp pains randomly throughout my torso area and it sometimes hurts more when I breathe in. 

I returned to the doctor and they said I had tracheitis (which I find unlikely since it's pretty rare and my voice was normal) and tonsillitis so they put me on antibiotics (10 days) and anti-inflammatory (3 days). During that time I felt worse and had multiple panic attacks (which I recognize I struggle with, but it had never been that bad) which took me to the ER and got sent back home with no diagnosis again and again. 

Since I didn't feel better at all after the antibiotics, I insisted and visited more doctors (general, cardiologist and endocrinologist) and made a full exam (blood tests, x ray and EKG, which all came back normal), they all said I'm fine and shouldn't worry. 

I then got a sore throat again and started producing more mucus (yellow), my nose is stuffy and I'm still getting back and chest pain (the cardiologist assured it was not my lungs, even though I do not think it's muscle related - pain medication doesn't help and it feels a lot like the pain I felt when I had pneumonia), my ears feel clogged, I'm getting easily light-headed and with tingling arms and legs (this part might be anxiety, for it comes and goes) and started coughing like hell. 

I understand I do have bad anxiety which may lead me to think I have a more serious condition than it actually is, but since my symptoms don't ever go away and may be getting progressively worse I don't think I could be THAT paranoid to make them all up. I believe that we can tell when our bodies are not working properly, and mine definitely isn't.

I needed some help to figure out what other questions I could possibly bring up to a new doctor, what exams I should ask for and which doctor should I try to attend. It has crossed my mind it could be a lung clot, bronchitis, allergies, sinus infection... I don't even know at this point, but my other doctors assured me it's nothing serious based on the exams I took. 

Sorry for the long post and hope I can get some help!

I’ve had some trouble for a while now, it started off as a feeling like I had mucus stuck in my throat and I’d need to clear it all the time, it became a bit of a habit clearing my throat all the time, but the feeling of mucus wouldn’t go away, then I started getting a feeling like a numb throat down the bottom middle and right side of throat, I went to doctor and she said everything looks fine, and o could be creating more mucus by trying to clear it all the time, gave me some nasal spray to use for a few weeks, a couple weeks went by and nothing much had changed, so went back again while I was getting my jabs, becuase I’m about to go to Thailand. And she just said it’s still looking fine and there’s nothing wrong she can see, and glands and stuff are fine. Then she told me to take the spray for another 2 weeks and to come back then and she’ll take a look and send me too an air/nose and throat specialist. But just within the last week my breathing has become a little bit restricted, it feels like my throat has closed in a bit and my breathing is louder. And I feel  short of breath at times. Like I can’t get a proper breath. I have mild asthma, and the doc tested my lungs and I blew over 650 on the tester, she said that was really good and it dosnt look like it’s my lungs. But at that time my breathing wasn’t bothering me. I also work our regularly and get a really tight back. Could that be pushing on my lungs? Or do you think it’s in my throat?

Worried.," Hi    I&#39;m looking for advice as this is getting me down now.  I started with a sore throat and cold on 24 June.  That turned into sinusitis and I also had a productive cough, severe headaches, and chest discomfort.  I went to walk in centre three times and each time was told chest is clear and it&#39;s just a virus.     On the second visit I was given antibiotics as preventative measure as I&#39;m prone to chest infections.     That carried on for a few weeks and I started to feel better around 16 July.     Then yesterday I woke up with a fever, stuffed nose and the cough again.     Today I have a dry cough and feel a strange tightness at the base of my throat and upper chest.  I also have upper back pain but that&#39;s not unusual for me.     I&#39;m really worried now because I feel like I can&#39;t catch a proper breath and I also have a metallic taste and my chest feels tight.  I&#39;ve always had a sore chest though, so that&#39;s not necessarily related to this.     I have two severe colds each year around July and December and they always turn into chest infections and take a good month or so to clear up.     Also when I&#39;m well, I&#39;m often clearing my throat to stop my voice being hoarse.      Can anyone help please?  I&#39;m worried in case this is pneumonia or something.

There&#39;s a suspicion of a genetic syndrome in my family, so myself and my baby (17 weeks) are going through a period of testing. Baby has an echocardiogram in two weeks, I just left mine.     The tech running the echo was lovely, but the first thing he said was &quot;definitely seeing fluid here&quot; then clarified it was not in the pericardium, but rather surrounding my lungs. I said &quot;I don&#39;t know if this is relevant, but I was hit with two bouts of pneumonia last winter&quot;. He said yes, that&#39;s probably where this came from.

I&#39;m only 26, no major health concerns, I don&#39;t smoke (I did in my teens and early twenties, but quit), and while the back to back pneumonia was suspicious it&#39;s been six months since symptoms resolved. So what&#39;s up with this fluid? Should I be pushing this and asking why we aren&#39;t treating fluid in the pleural space as pleural effusion? Or should I thank my lucky stars I feel no symptoms and write this off as part of recovery from my pneumonia nightmare?    Would so appreciate any thoughts, thank you all.  ","I had a pleural effusion. They should drain the fluid and check it for bacteria and for cancer. If they drain the fluid you will find it is much easier to breathe. 
Main causes are pneumonia or cancer, also can be caused by other microorganisms eg. TB, or viruses.

You chould definitely talk to your doctor, get them to 1. Drain and test the fjuid 2. Do an MRI or CAT scan to rule out other factors (like mine) - not just of the chest but of the entire thing

Thanks.
","Cleaning products can contain some nasty preservatives and chemicals which can give some people breathing problems. So If she could get some eco friendly cleaning products this could help a lot. I have an allergy to certain preservatives which are in so many products from cleaning products to fabric softeners.  Methylisothiazolinone allergy is quite common and can effect breathing as well as skin. This and similar products ending in isothizolinone are used in loads of cleaning products, shampoos, face washes, washing up liquid, etc. Try and go through all her products and get rid of anything with this in and replace with eco friendly products.

Tomorrow we're starting the antibiotic treatment.

I've learned that pneumonia this late in life is one of the leading causes of death. I know it's life-threatening. I'm so scared. I don't want to lose my Grandmother like this. We (my mother, brother and I) have made sure she stayed at home with her relatives, loved and taken care of, insted of being placed to an elderly home. We've taken a good care of her since she was diagnosed with Alzheimer and couldn't take care of herself. Apparently, it wasn't enough.

It can be hard to see any relative with a life threatening illness. How bad is her dementia? Alzheimer's is such a cruel condition when loved ones are no longer recognised and behaviour becomes difficult to cope with.
Pneumonia can respond well to antibiotics and she has a good chance of recovery but a period in hospital can lead to much distress and confusion and deterioration of mental state.

","Some of the side effects heart ace inhibitors are coughing. If your mom has had or has an allergy issues,  drainage down her throat from her sinuses that can also be caused by cold weather. That will make her cough. Then the added side effects from heart meds can increase the coughing to horrible levels.  Talk with your dr.s about this, do not take yourself off any meds on your own. If it is an effect from medications it can take a month or more to rectify. Look up the heart meds side effects along with forums of what people have experienced on the meds.

I have a strange condition in that whenever I cough I end up choking and not being able to breathe properly - it lasts for no more than a minute and goes away by calming down and breathing through my nose.  My GP thinks it is a left over symptom from a recent cold virus and he has given me an inhaler to take when I can feel it coming on (which does help).  What's bothering me at the moment is that when eating I'm also finding that things are just shooting down the wrong way quite frequently, e.g. when eating a biscuit it doesn't take much for a crumb to shoot down the wrong way leading to a cough and then to choking (and me panicking!).   Generally, I'm absolutely fine though I do often feel like I have a lump in my throat just where my adams apple is.  I'm also drooling a lot more than I used to as well.

I'm in my 40s and larger than I should be (BMI = 31).  Slightly confused what this could be.  I do intend to go back to my GP after Christmas.

","Phlegm or sputum often accompanies colds and other upper respiratory infections. While not a serious health problem, if phlegm is not treated timely, it can clog and irritate the bronchial tubes and in turn cause a secondary upper respiratory infection.  The presence of phlegm is usually indicated by a constant need for throat clearing, constant cough, runny nose, difficulty breathing, feeling weak and, in some cases, fever. Phlegm tends to collect and congest in the chest and throat and is usually expelled through coughing.  Phlegm contains the bacteria, virus or inflammatory cells produced in response to an infection. In addition to infections such as the common cold, flu and bronchitis, phlegm can be caused by an allergic reaction to irritants such as in asthma and hay fever, damaged vocal cords, and excessive smoking.",negative,neutral,

Help","Asthma is a disease that causes the airways of the lungs to swell and narrow, leading to wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, which will cause you to wheeze and cough. You will feel breathless because it will be difficult to move air in and out of your airways. Position is important in air flow. Most asthma problems are at night, even if your disease is controlled. Some people have worse breathing problems when lying down. A lot of this probably depends on body types, asthma severity and if one has some anxiety struggles with anticipating asthma. You can try grape seed extract, try amino acid lysine to tackle this situation.

My Mother had the flu about 3 weeks ago, which was accompanied by a sore throat, and drowsiness. The congestion passed after about 5 days, but the cough has remained for almost 3 weeks. Doctor tested it a week ago, but it was not strep and he didn't know what it was but said it seemed like a virus. Yesterday night she noticed some hives all over her body, and the following morning, she woke up and fainted, still with hives, and with a 96 degree temperature, some nausea. Doctor gave a steroid for the hives, and some steroid pills. Hives returned later on in the day, along with a hoarse throat. The cough persists, not seeming to improve.
What could this be? Doctor doesn't know, and we cant find it on the internet. I found that a chronic cough could be linked to acid reflux, and she does drink two cups of coffee every morning. She also has had a light cough for the last several years, and has been burping more than I do or more than I notice other people - perhaps something in her diet is wrong and causing some stomach acid to scar her throat, irritating it, and exacerbating a cough from flu/nasal drip? She says she has had sinus congestion/pressure before and that she once lost sense of smell for a while. She didn't eat anything out of the ordinary prior to the hives - she went to work, then yoga, then shopping, then had some dinner of rice and chicken - all as usual. Not heavy pollen out now. It was not overly hot out when she fainted, and her blood pressure and EKG were fine. Other than coffee, her diet is quite good - lots of vegetables, no junk food, no smoking, rare alcohol. She works in an office in a university, and gets exercise from yoga, walking.
What could cause her to faint? What could cause these hives? What could cause this cough? What connects these all together?

812,Chronic Cough - Very worried please help with some advise,/forums/discuss/chronic-cough-very-worried-please-help-with-some-advise-552298,37,Respiratory,Chronic Cough - Very worried please help with some advise," Hello all, this is my first post here and I am very worried. If you can give me some advice I would greatly appreciate it. My wife, aged 32 active female nonsmoker had a cold with a very slight fever about 7 weeks ago. She got better in a few days but lost her voice for a day or two from which she recovered well. However, after that, she began coughing and has been for 6 weeks now. At the beginning, I got her &#160;an OTC anti-inflammatory spray and some lozenges. The spray didn&#39;t help and mad her gag a few times. We went to the first GP and he said her lungs were fine and gave her an expectorant. She was coughing all throughout the day, sometimes in fits. The expectorant didn&#39;t work and we went to the ER. They gave us a cough syrup, some ibuprofen, and an antihistamine. We barely saw any improvement and the cough came back when we stopped the syrup. &#160;We went again to the ER to follow up and they gave us Codeine syrup, again an antihistamine and some antacids. We didn&#39;t see any improvement and were frustrated so we ordered a chest x-ray which was clear. We went to a lung specialist and he said it could be asthma (even though she has never had any breathing problems and is very energetic). He gave her an inhaler with steroids which she has been using for 24 hours and we haven&#39;t seen any improvement. She has not been sleeping at all for 3 days and took some codeine phosphate syrup last night just so she can sleep for a few hours. This morning, the cough is back.  She has no symptoms associated with what I&#39;ve read online. No fever, weight loss, night sweats, weakness, fatigue, chest pain, shoulder pain, difficulty breathing, clubbing, coughing up blood. Nothing.  She also says she feels two kinds of coughs. One that comes from her lungs which she feels better when she coughs something out (even though there is nothing that comes out), and another one that comes from a very itchy throat. She says she feels her throat is scratched. Sometimes, steam showers help her, other times not so much. I have been reading so much online and I am very worried, distressed and unable to cope/function. We both haven&#39;t slept much are unable to work. I have taken a leave from my job. A part of me feels that it is a cough and it will pass and the other part&#160;wants to make sure I do everything in my power and whatever it takes to see my wife not suffering this much. Last night she coughed till the point of gagging and almost vomiting. I read about tumors, and pulmonary fibrosis and got so worried - but after 6 stethoscopes and an x-ray, wouldn&#39;t one of those doctors notice something abnormal in her lungs? She has no genetic history of any of these diseases.  It is worth mentioning that her aunt (not blood-related) developed a respiratory disease after starting a new job as a municipality Gardner. They initially thought it was asthma. And within 2 months she had lost around 15kg - ending up with 2 lung biopsies and eventually dying (all within 3 months). Nobody ever told me what she had, the family was too distressed to know. She was basically a healthy 55-year-old casual smoker who was fit and active. She weighed around 50KG.  So we are very paranoid about why my wife is coughing that much and I would appreciate any help/advice/insight because I feel miserable.  Thank you.

When it first started happening and had stayed with me for about 2 to 3 weeks, I was convinced I had the milder form of Covid-19. However, I was told that because I didn't (and still don't) have a temperature or any other symptoms, it isn't that.

Usually, it is worst in the morning and early afternoon and then again in the evening and at night (not because I'm laying down, it happens even when sitting up). Seems to be less in the afternoons.

Some days it is worse than others. Some days it is minimal, and I think it's starting to go away, then the next day it will come back with a vengeance. Most days it is truly so horrible. 

I should say I currently have no other symptoms - I think I feel fine otherwise, it's just this dry cough, but it really is very debilitating and it's so bad that I've been thinking I cannot live with this and have considered suicide if it continues and never ever goes away. That's how bad it is most of the time.

Since the age of 14 (I'm now early 30s!) I've suffered and lived with chronic post-nasal drip on a daily basis (i've never seen a doctor about this btw). Is it possible it's linked??

I'm so worried that this may be a sign of something very sinister, like cancer (I'm thinking lymphoma or Leukemia?).

I'm ever so scared and I'm sat here in tears as I type this post out. Please, is this serious? Can anyone offer their thoughts? Anyone experienced the same?

Before I start I'll just state that I'm 19 years old, slim and generally healthy. I've been suffering with a cough for 3 weeks now, and it only seems to be getting worse. It is a constant violent cough, dry, but wet if that makes sense? I cough up clear mucus.  It seems worse at night, I can't lie down without having a coughing fit and the pain in my throat and my ribs is unbearable :( I also have awful pains in my upper back, and weird shooting nerve pains in my arms.  I've been to the doctors twice, first time he listened to my heart and lungs said they were clear and said I had Costochondritis which is causing my pain. Didn't say anything about my cough. So I went back to see a different doctor, by now I was also having pains in my left leg and googling this and as always it comes up with the worst case scenario... Blood clots which got me really worked up. She told me I didn't have blood clots, just by feeling my leg and saying it was soft, and said I have acid reflux which is causing my cough and all the other symptoms. I still can't stop worrying that my cough is something much worse and I have been misdiagnosed and there is something wrong with my lungs :( I also keep worrying about the pain in my leg, which is getting worse... I feel as if it was just brushed off but when I read online about others who ended up having blood clots their symptoms were just like mine and I'm so scared of this happening to me :( 
I realise I have really bad health anxiety, but it makes it worse that I haven't even had proper tests or anything done to rule out the worst things!

thank you ","Hello,

I am very sorry to hear about your chest problems. 

About 8 or 9 years   ago  I started getting bronchial infections, pretty well one after another.  I too ws given inhalers and they talked about asthma, I had never had  asthma, tried them but they didn't do any good .  Was taken into hospital where they did scans and xrays I had coughing fits until I was sick and at one time I could not breathe at all. I panicked and thought I was on the way out!

 This went on and they were scratching their heads until back at the GP's I saw a young Dr freshly hatched, and she thought some more bloods would be good but this time including Vitamins  and B12  especially. One other was VitD  and Calcium.
 
 When these came back I was very low in B12,Vit D and Calcium.  At that time I was 68 yrs old. Now that opened a brand new can of worms  and I read that some people cannot absorb  B12 from their stomach.  People sometimes end up with Pernicious Anaemia.   I have injections now as I didn't
Well,after a while I got no more breathing problems and chronic chest infections and I gradually got less fatigued .I live with that now,it was not plain sailing and I have had some problems  and I deal with them as they occur, 

I don't know if my answer will help you. because as you know there are many other causes it could be tied up with. I would be pleased to learn if you have been sorted.
Good luck to you,
Bigsby.

With this pandemic world-wide I can not find a clinic to have a control at the moment, probably I can go if it's a urgent situation at the hospital, but I hope that is not the case, and have at least a attending/directional answer here.

A few days ago I started having coughs with expectoration, not too many a maximum of 20 per day or so. They are easy to expectorate, usually takes just one cough and the phlegm is out. I also seem that whenever I stay in cold I start to get a cold usually and I have mild lung pain (lungs might not hurt but that is the area) .  I remember last time I had lung/back musle pain was quite hard, was during when I lifted something , it held me around 2 days and was quite unpleasant. That was around 2 months ago. 
I do also have wheezing. 

It might be that I have a common cold, or who knows, but what worries me is that I've been having phlegms before, usually lasting around 10 days or even less, around one time per year, maybe twice. Always when having a cold.  

I read, symptoms are similar to Bronchitis, Acute or Chronic.   Could this might be ? Or a common cold, probably Covid-19 ? 

I should mention that in rest I'm feeling well, I do work-out and gained weight in the past few months, except sometimes (last few days) when I work out I get so very sweaty and even nauseous. Sometimes even shortness of breath when/after the workout.  I am also a smoker , I promised myself I will stop them in the following weeks. And have a low immunity system, or lower, been prescribed with taking Vitamin C + Zinc for 3 months.

Oh, since I was a little kid I was always getting a cold very easily. Even nowadays I seem to get a common cold easily. 

Probably I should have gone earlier to check my lungs too, but I decided to leave them to last, meanwhile checked other problems, have Sinusitis and Otitis. And another two probably small problems not related to lungs or head.

Thanks.","Hi, My opinion is with those symptoms  I would go and get check out just to make sure its not Covid 19 and then you can go from there. Better to be safe than sorry. probably a common cold

910,Long term difficulty breathing after complication-filled gallbladder surgery,/forums/discuss/long-term-difficulty-breathing-after-complication-filled-gallbladder-surgery-683846,2,Respiratory,Long term difficulty breathing after complication-filled gallbladder surgery,"My health has been suffering for about 5 years now. I went through a nightmare experience with my gallbladder removal and my life truly hasn’t been the same since. I would like to thank you in advance for reading the following timeline as it is a long one - I appreciate it!
Listed below is a timeline of my symptoms:
Late 2013: Began to develop severe and debilitating pain on right side, stretching around to my back. Pain occurred shortly after eating and would last for a few hours and eventually subside.
Early 2014: After explaining symptoms to PCP, I was referred for ultrasound. Ultrasound found gallstones, and my severe pain was properly diagnosed as gallstone attacks. I was referred for a consultation with a surgeon, but I had to reschedule due to a blizzard.
Early June 2014: Gallstone attacks became more frequent and more severe to the point that they were occurring daily after most meals. Before I could go to my consultation with the surgeon, during an especially painful gallstone attack, I went to the ER. I was admitted to the hospital and was scheduled for a cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal).  My gallbladder was removed the next day but as a complication from surgery I had internal bleeding that was not found during the surgery. While staying the night in the hospital I became extremely weak and passed out, but I was able to summon a nurse before losing consciousness. A code blue was enacted, and I was administered IV bolus for resuscitation. I had a massive amount of internal bleeding that was never cleared by the surgeon. Received blood transplant. Shortly thereafter developed infection and was administered antibiotics. Eventually improving, I was released from the hospital 5 days after cholecystectomy.
Late June 2014: About 1-2 weeks after being released from hospital, I had a severe gallstone attack despite no longer having a gallbladder. I simultaneously began showing signs of jaundice (yellowing skin and eyes) and my urine was deep red in color due to bilirubin. I was re-admitted to the hospital. After several tests, it was confirmed that I had “biliary sludge” blockage in my bile duct. An ERCP was performed and the sludge was flushed out. Apparently, the sludge was supposed to have been flushed during gallbladder removal surgery but never was. After another 5-day hospitalization, I eventually improved after the ERCP and was released without symptoms.
Late 2014 – 2016: After my gallbladder was removed, I had difficulty eating some foods and would get occasional stomach ache/diarrhea. These seemed to be a normal result of cholecystectomy and I didn’t think too much about it, and just avoided certain foods that bothered my stomach.
Early-Mid 2017: About 2.5 years after cholecystectomy, I began to experience difficulty breathing that felt like I couldn’t get a full breath. The severity of the breathing difficulty would fluctuate, becoming more severe at times. After it persisted for more than a month, I saw my PCP who scheduled an EKG and chest X-ray, both of which came back normal. Oxygen levels were tested and found to be normal. I was referred to an Ear Nose & Throat Doctor who performed a Laryngoscopy and found esophageal inflammation. ENT diagnosed Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) and prescribed a course of Omeprazole and Zantac. These medications did not improve my symptoms and seemed to make them worse. I eventually stopped taking them.
Mid 2018: I began to experience a very large increase in severity of symptoms. Difficulty breathing, inflammation in throat, pain on right side of chest. PCP referred me to Gastroenterologist (the same one who performed ERCP after gallbladder removal complications). Upper endoscopy was performed and found no symptoms of esophagitis, no bile reflux, no acid reflux, and no hiatal hernia. Gastro told me it’s probably anxiety, which I respectfully but wholeheartedly disagree with. I tried several treatments such as improving my diet to eliminate sugar and gluten, taking slippery elm supplements, and sleeping with a wedge pillow. These actions, however, did not lessen severity of my symptoms.
Present (October 2018): My symptoms have been severe for several months now but as of a few months ago I was laid off from my job and can no longer afford diagnostic appointments to get to the bottom of my health problem. I have been treating my case as if it were Costochondritis and doing stretches with the Backpod. These attempts have also proven unsuccessful. My symptoms are more severe than ever, and I can barely walk a short distance without feeling short of breath. I have intermittent chest pain on right side of my chest that feels like it is possibly located more in my chest wall than my lungs.
I’m currently suffering without a real diagnosis. I am currently trying to research medical articles that point to cholecystectomies causing complications with lung function as well as the possibility of gallstone ectopia in the lungs. These articles are filled with complex terminology, so they are difficult to understand. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
","OMG first of all, I feel for you, since it looks like you have not been taken seriously by your doctors. Have you tried inhalers? Sounds stupid, but it helped I used mine for about a week and I finally could breathe. Have you talked to an attorney? Maybe you could have a malpractice case? 
At night when I can't go to sleep I breathe in, to the count of 5, hold my breath  to the count of 5 and blow out my breath loudly to the count of 5.
It helps me go to sleep.  I had my gallbladder removed and was lucky that I had a fabulous surgeon. I have little itty bitty tweaks inside, but I guess that is normal.
My entire misere started when I had a root canal by my dentist, who hit my Trigeminal nerve.  I encountered the most horrible pain. So my dentist ordered 800 mg Ibuprofen every  4 hours. Did that for 2 weeks and it didn't help, ended up in the ER, they yelled at me since I could have killed my kidneys with the Ibuprofen, am staying away from it now.  I am  for the rest of my life having to take Tegretol, since that is the only help  with Trigeminal nerve pain , side effects are, that my mind forgets things - which sucks! I contacted a few lawyers, but nobody touches dental problems!

I hope you get some help.  Could you get Medicaid? 

Good luck!

919,11 year old with constant horrible cold symptoms,/forums/discuss/11-year-old-with-constant-horrible-cold-symptoms-639180,4,Respiratory,11 year old with constant horrible cold symptoms," My daughter, age 11, has been stuck with horrible cold-like symptoms for about a year now. The main thing is that her nose is awfully congested and runny (if she leans back, you can see how filled and overflowing it is). She also has a minor wet cough, but that is much more manageable.      By now we have figured out quite the &quot;system&quot; - since she needs to blow her nose every 2-10 minutes (no joke), she has packs of tissues in her desk and bag at school, there are boxes all over my house, and at dance, she makes sure there is always a box in the studio she&#39;s dancing in. But she is very uncomfortable. And now as she&#39;s becoming a more competitive dancer, competitions have been very difficult for us (for her solo, she was blowing her nose until she went on stage and I was ready with a tissue backstage for when she came off) and we are still too scared to send her to a convention. And it doesn&#39;t help that she can&#39;t breathe through her nose, so she gets out of breath so quickly.&#160;      We can&#39;t really&#160;travel with her or even go on day trips because of this. When we went on a ski trip, she skied one day, constantly stopping on the hill for tissues and water (her throat gets so dry because of her heavy mouth breathing) and she came home with the messiest face mask and jacket I&#39;ve ever seen. She didn&#39;t ski another day. And when we went to Florida, she was in the room for most of the day because she couldn&#39;t really swim. And car/plane rides are miserable.&#160;&#160;    The coping mechanisms we&#39;ve developed so far, besides keeping tissues handy at all times, have been a) we do a sinus rinse every few days (haven&#39;t found this to be helpful) b) she does nasal spray five times a day (7, 11, 2:30, 6 or 7, before bed) which we have found to be helpful, but you&#39;re supposed to clear your nose before which she can&#39;t really do.. c) she will occasionally take a decongestant. Her nose is also so red and raw from blowing it like 2 or 3 hundred times a day so we put stuff on it for her whenever she needs it. And she has an inhaler for when her cough is bad.&#160;    We&#39;ve gone to our doctor and some specialists and the only answer they&#39;ve had has been that it is very severe nonallergic rhinitis and that something is causing her mucus to rapidly overproduce (I know, gross!). They say surgery couldn&#39;t help because it&#39;s not about her adenoids or anything like that.    So, do you guys have any ideas of what could be causing this or any ideas for some more coping mechanisms to help? Thank you so much :) ","I would be getting her to an otolaryngologist as soon as possible.

939,Mysterious air hunger,/forums/discuss/mysterious-air-hunger-726227,10,Respiratory,Mysterious air hunger,"Hello, there is already a forum posted about this mysterious air hunger and constant need to yawn/ inhale deeply (like an itch) , but i thought id start a new thread by the chance others may see it. 

For me, this seemingly unbreakable cycle of shallow breath followed by one large upper chest yawn, started around 6 years ago. it was at a time of high stress and anxiety in my life, and i did have a lot of depression and anxiety in the years before that, so that does give me a deep feeling that the root of this is phychological. 

It feels so physical, though. Maybe its a psychological thing that has manifested into a physical thing? The brain is that powerful. Anyways,  i have seen doctors for ashthma, anxiety meds, speech therapy for vocal dysfunction, a pulmonologist - and nothing has given me any relief. The only thing that has somewhat eased it is TIME and LIFESTYLE CHANGES. But its still there, like a constant itch. I cant even speak properly because most of the time i speak i run out of breath. 

Could be horrible anxiety manifestations, but again it feels so physical, like a tight upper chest and im inhaling through a straw. My inhales and exhales are usually uneven. I hold my breath. Im still not going to rule out physical causes - the next thing im going to look at is the possibility of Silent Reflux or GI tract problems playing a hand in it. After that, there is a long list of possibilities that will keep me busy. theres so many ways your body can stop breathing properly - not just ashthma and anxiety. Hope someone in the same struggle sees this, please reply. ","It maybe that you have got into the bad habit of shallow, fast breathing  and now it has become established,  I know for myself if I start to shallow breathe I eventually take in a huge breathe and with my condition that hurts.  I really have to take note and breathe from my diaphragm.  Maybe you can look up breathing exercises on the Internet to get yourself into the habit of breathing correctly.  Best of luck, the more you panic the worse you will breathe even if you haven't got a problem.

I have a tight feeling in my chest, breathing feels shallow I guess. I feel like I&#39;m not getting enough air in.&#160;  This is the 2ed time I&#39;ve had this problem but the first time wasn&#39;t as bad as it has been lately. The first time this happened I had the feeling to burp and some tightness in my chest. But lately it&#39;s gotten worse. The burping has stopped but the tightness has gotten worse in my chest to the point where it makes it impossible to sleep the breathing isn&#39;t as bad tho if I&#39;m distracted it doesn&#39;t bother me but when I lay down It gets bad, hard to breath and the tightness gets worse. When I sit up or stand or bend over slightly like over my bed or the counter there&#39;s some relief to the tightness.&#160;  Anything helps please, I have school starting soon I need my sleep and normal breathing back!!
